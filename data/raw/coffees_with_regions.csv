Butter, dark chocolate, plum/apricot and a hint of raisin in aroma and small cup. Smooth, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. A hint of chocolate carries into a delicate, drying finish. In three parts milk the dark chocolate continues to dominate, with a backgrounded apricot-like fruit."
"Mexican El Triunfo Fair Trade Organic"|"Mystic Monk Coffee"|"91"|"Clark"|"Wyoming"|"Chiapas State, Mexico"|"Mexico"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Deep, sweet-toned, gently pungent. Dark chocolate in particular dominates in aroma and cup, with hints of raisin, fresh-cut pine and mint. Round, resonant acidity; smooth mouthfeel. Very sweet in the finish, with raisin and chocolate notes in particular persisting."
"Peruvian Cafe Feminino Cacanor Coop"|"Just Love Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Murfreesboro"|"Tennessee"|"Lambayeque region, Peru"|"Peru"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. This delicate, gently bright espresso attracted gently expressed support from both Ken (91) and his co-taster (90). Crisp, hazelnut-toned aroma; light but lively, effervescent mouthfeel. Ripe lemon and caramel in flavor and finish, where the co-taster also found a tickle of sweet black pepper. Maintained presence nicely in three parts milk, where the co-taster found it “immensely sweet and clean with lemon character.”"
"Panama Boquete Finca Kotowa Don-K Natural"|"CafeTaster"|"91"|"I-Lan City"|"Taiwan"|"Boquete growing region, western Panama"|"Panama"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Ken (92) showed considerably more enthusiasm for this intense dried-in-the-fruit profile than his only mildly respectful co-taster (89). The co-taster associated the usual fermented fruit notes with wine and spiced cider, Ken with bourbon whisky (which he likes). The co-taster found the fermented fruit notes complicated by “sweet hay and malt,” Ken by a more decisive “fresh-cut cedar.” Ken rated the lightly syrupy, perhaps buttery mouthfeel a bit higher than did his co-taster. Both found the shot pleasantly chocolaty in three parts milk, additionally nuanced by malt for the co-taster, by cedar for Ken."
"AIPEP Bolivian Fair Trade Espresso"|"Just Coffee Cooperative"|"91"|"Madison"|"Wisconsin"|"Caranavi Province, La Paz Department, Bolivia"|"Bolivia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Ken rated this softly bright espresso three points higher at 92 than the co-taster did at 89. Ken simply seems to have found more going on and liked what he found better: a fuller mouthfeel, a slightly more complex set of aromatics (for Ken citrus, honey, flowers, chocolate; for his co-taster taster citrus, praline, pear), a longer finish and a more complex, persistent flavor in milk."
"Guatemala Finca La Perla"|"Conduit Coffee"|"91"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"El Quiche Department, south central Guatemala"|"Guatemala"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Evaluated as espresso. Ken (91) and his co-taster (91) recorded identical scores and very similar readings for this lively, balanced espresso: in aroma and flavor sweetly tart fruit (orange, lemon, kiwi) rounded by flowers for Ken and “sweet pea” for the co-taster; smooth, lightly syrupy mouthfeel; most impressively a very sweet finish with chocolate and cinnamon suggestions. Delicately chocolaty in three parts milk (“pure milk chocolate” according to the co-taster)."
"El Salvador Natural Finca Malacara"|"Bacca Cafe"|"91"|"Tainan City"|"Taiwan"|"Volcan de Santa Ana regioin, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Ken (93) and his co-taster (88) went rather different ways on this deep, sweet, brandyish, lightly herby dried-in-the-fruit profile. Ken enjoyed the overripe, fermenty fruit notes in aroma and cup; his co-taster was not greatly impressed. Both had good things to say about the mouthfeel (co-taster: “huge and enveloping”); on the other hand, neither were impressed by the rather astringent finish. Ken admired the impact in three parts milk (“juicy and rich”) more than did his co-taster, who found it pleasantly berryish but a bit too tart."
"Costa Rica Lomas Al Rio Honey Espresso"|"Temple Coffee and Tea"|"91"|"Sacramento"|"California"|"West Valley growing region, Costa Rica"|"Costa_Rica"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (91) and his co-taster (90) admired a gently bright, citrus-and-berry character in the small cup; Ken found distinct floral suggestions as well. A dark chocolate note emerged clearly and perhaps surprisingly in the finish. Citrus, chocolate and (for Ken) flowers all carried with grace into three parts milk."
"Ninety Plus Nekisse N2 S.O. Espresso"|"Cafe Est"|"92"|"New Taipei City"|"Taiwan"|"Sidamo (also Sidama) growing region, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (93) and his co-taster (91) enjoyed this crisp and rather cleanly wine- and brandy-toned dried-in-the-fruit profile, though Ken enjoyed it two rating points more. The co-taster read “berries, pineapple and dried fruits” in the small cup; Ken’s associations ran to parallel descriptors of grape, orange, apricot and fresh-cut cedar. Both admired the shot in three parts milk, citing a deep, balanced sweetness that for Ken was pleasantly viscous and “banana-like.”"
"Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Guji Natural"|"Seattle Coffee Works"|"92"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (93) and his co-taster (91) admired the wine-like intensity of this dried-in-the-fruit profile, though Ken read more complexity, in particular floral top notes, in flavor and finish. Both tasters cited a creamy mouthfeel and consistent finish. Especially impressive in three parts milk, where the shot bloomed with a complex expression of fruit-toned chocolate."
"Guatemala Santa Sofia Lot 3"|"Revel Coffee"|"92"|"Billings"|"Montana"|"Alta Verapaz Department, north-central Guatemala"|"Guatemala"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Dark"|"Evaluated as espresso. In the small cup both Ken (91) and his co-taster (92) admired the bright, refreshing fruit (strawberry in particular) rounded by a fudgy chocolate, an impressively syrupy mouthfeel, and a flavor-saturated but clean finish. Vivacious in three parts milk: orange zest and caramel."
"Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Kochere Grade 1 Espresso"|"Victrola Coffee Roasters"|"92"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Kochere District, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Ken (91) liked this bright, zesty espresso; his co-taster (92) liked it even better. Both admired the citrus and floral vivacity of the aroma and flavor. Ken and his co-taster both accepted the smooth though rather light mouthfeel as an appropriate complement to the lively aromatics; both enjoyed the emergence of a lower-toned fruit (fig, roasted cacao nib) in the finish. Ken found the sweet-citrus impact in three parts milk a bit more pleasing than his co-taster did, though the co-taster offered an apt descriptor for it: “key lime pie.”"
"Organic Colombia SOS Fondo Paez Cooperative"|"Conscious Coffee"|"93"|"Boulder"|"Colorado"|"Valle de Cauca Department, western Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Evaluated as espresso. Ken (93) and his co-taster (93) both admired this roundly and very discreetly roast-influenced espresso. They found the aroma deeply pungent, the flavor complex with a wide range of sensation: raisin, apricot, flowers, fresh-cut cedar, “crisp, fresh berry” (co-taster). Ken particularly admired the full, syrupy (for the co-taster buttery) mouthfeel. Long, sweet, cedary (Ken’s word) finish. The co-taster in particular made a case for this espresso in three parts milk, where it showed chocolate and a fresh, sugar-cane-like sweetness."
"Kenya AB Top Lot Single-Origin Espresso"|"Simon Hsieh's Aroma Roast Coffees"|"94"|"Taoyuan City"|"Taiwan"|"Nyeri growing region, south-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"Evaluated as espresso.

Gently scorched fir and earth notes hint at dark chocolate, complicated by a pungent citrus that clearly suggests grapefruit.

"Brazil Ouro Fino"|"Reunion Island Coffee"|"89"|"Oakville"|"Ontario"|"Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Deep, resonant, very sweet-toned in aroma and cup.

"Kenya Igandene"|"Java Blend Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Halifax"|"Nova Scotia"|"South-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Bright but balanced. Tart coffee fruit reads as a crisp-toned but lavish layering of cherry, orange and lemon suggestions with an anchoring hint of fresh-cut fir. Intense but sweet-toned acidity; lightly silky mouthfeel.

Sweet-toned and quietly complex: pungent fir and dark chocolate dominate, with top-note hints of lemon and flowers. Mouthfeel is smooth if slightly lean; cleanly rich, straightforward finish. At best in two parts milk, where the chocolate softens and rounds to fill out the milk nicely, complicated by continued suggestions of lemon and fir."

The sweet, exuberant ferment seems to turn the mouthfeel almost effervescent. Sweetness and flavor outlast a hint of astringency in the long finish."
"Burundi Kinyovu Micro-Mill"|"Fratello Coffee Roasters"|"92"|"Calgary"|"Alberta"|"Kayanza Province, Burundi"|"Burundi"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Rich fruit-toned aroma turns pungent in the cup, displaying an intense black-currant-laced chocolate with hints of flowers and lemon. Soft but penetrating acidity and silky mouthfeel. Dark chocolate in particular lingers in the sweet-toned finish."
"Colombia La Esperanza Micro-lot"|"Paradise Roasters"|"91"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"Huila Department, Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"A relatively light roast develops this pure high-grown coffee’s giddy natural sweetness, delicately bright acidity and tart fruit notes.

"Sumatra Aceh"|"Fratello Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Calgary"|"Alberta"|"Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Light"|"Notes of nut, milk chocolate and aromatic wood dominate the aroma. In the cup the aromatics intensify, highlighted by rich, albeit slightly musty tones of dark chocolate, toasted almond and suggestions of citrus fruit and baking spices.

"Burundi Kinyovu"|"Kaldi's Coffee"|"90"|"St. Louis"|"Missouri"|"Kayanza Province, Burundi"|"Burundi"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Deep, dark-chocolaty aroma turns crisper in the small cup, which co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) read as dry, “limeish” and floral, Ken (90) as more orangy and anise-like. Rich, dry, very long finish with a clear citrus edge. Two parts milk revives a delicate and cocoaish version of the chocolate, rounding the citrus and flowers."
"Peru Cruz Del Sur"|"Intelligentsia Coffee"|"90"|"Chicago"|"Illinois"|"Chirinos, Peru"|"Peru"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Although Ken (90) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) produced identical ratings, they read this coffee a bit differently, with Sean emphasizing its brightish citrus and floral tendencies while Ken added dark chocolate and hint of brandy. Sean’s citrus inclined more toward lemon and lime, Ken’s toward a deeper-toned orange. Both read the small cup as medium in weight though slightly lean in mouthfeel, but admired the sample’s performance in two parts milk, finding it smooth, creamy, complex: berry, flowers, lemony cocoa."
"Mexico Nayarita"|"Velton's Coffee"|"90"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Nayarit, Mexico"|"Mexico"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Co-taster Sean Kohmescher (92) and Ken (88) split on this coffee and how to read its deep, ferment-toned fruit. Sean enjoyed the distinctive character of the fruit: “stone-fruited chocolate” with a hint of grapefruit. Ken read the same fruit but also picked up nagging musty/salty tendencies. Two parts milk smoothed things out a bit for Ken, developing a chocolaty sweetness, though Sean remained more committed here also, praising the shot’s “light, sweet, berries and cream” performance in milk."
"Echo Blend Taiwan Espresso"|"Simon Hsieh's Aroma Roast Coffees"|"91"|"Taoyuan City"|"Taiwan"|"Taiwan"|"Taiwan"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Ken, at 92, liked this unusual sample better than co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) did, perhaps because Ken read more depth in the aromatics and flavor. Sean stopped at citrus, honey and caramel in aroma and small cup whereas Ken added dark chocolate and pungent fir. Ken also found a bit more going on in the finish, with flowers complicating a deep, bananaish chocolate. In two parts milk Ken and Sean read the cup about the same although applying slightly different language, with Sean citing lemon and ”light caramel” and Ken a “lemony chocolate.”"
"Single Origin Espresso Colombia El Paraiso Farm"|"Cafe Grumpy"|"91"|"Brooklyn"|"New York"|"Huila Department, Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Gently tart, lemony, delicate. Co-taster Sean Kohmescher (91) was a bit more lavish in his descriptors than Ken (91): “bright citrus” in the aroma; more sweet citrus, vanilla, hints of flowers and honey in the small cup; vanilla and cranberries in the finish. Ken pretty much left it at lemon and flowers. The lemon dominated in two parts milk, but the milk coaxed out a sweet chocolate to round and support it."
"Ethiopia Anyetsu Espresso"|"Novo Coffee"|"91"|"Denver"|"Colorado"|"Wellega, Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Complex dried-in-the-fruit profile. “Berries and more berries” in the aroma for co-taster Sean Kohmescher (91). For Ken (91) berries plus a lot of other notes: brandy, malty dark chocolate, fresh-cut cedar. In the small cup Sean felt the aromatics turned crisper and drier: lemon, flowers, green bitters (as in asparagus); Ken read the same rounder, brandyish, cedary berries-and-chocolate notes as he had in the aroma. Both found the body medium and the mouthfeel silky. Rather crisp in two parts milk; cocoa for Ken, lemon and flowers for Sean."
"Brazil Moreninha Formosa Raisin"|"Muddy Dog Roasting"|"92"|"Morrisville"|"North Carolina"|"Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Although both Ken (94) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) lavished a bundle of descriptors on this complex and challenging espresso, the real issue was how much to honor a pungent, musky character as it plays out in a well-pulled espresso. Both Ken and Sean were puzzled by the unusual aroma, but Sean, as he followed it into the cup, found it pleasing but just a bit edgy, perhaps musty, whereas Ken enthusiastically read it rich with the sort of pungent, earthy grapefruit character one finds in the best Sumatras. In two parts milk Sean found this flavor complex “musky” and “antique”; for Ken it was suavely nut-like."
"Burundi Kiryama Micro Lot"|"Olympia Coffee Roasting"|"93"|"Olympia"|"Washington"|"Burundi"|"Burundi"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (93) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (93) admired sweet-toned floral and bright lemony suggestions broadened by leather-like, musky bottom notes. Medium to full body, syrupy mouthfeel. Cocoaish chocolate and hints of lemon and flowers carry pleasingly into two parts milk."
"Bolivia Caranavi Cenaproc Co-op"|"Victrola Coffee Roasters"|"94"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Caranavi growing region, Bolivia"|"Bolivia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (94) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (94) remarked on and enjoyed distinct and subtly unusual roasted nut and fudgy (Sean’s term) chocolate notes in aroma and small cup. Also some fruit complication (orange for Ken, berry for Sean). Medium to full body, smooth mouthfeel, and a superb finish that just keeps coming, carrying subtly transforming flavor notes far into the reaches of sensory memory. Fades just a bit in two parts milk, but remains pleasing and balanced."
"Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Addis Ketema North Italian Espresso Roast"|"Terroir Coffee"|"94"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Evaluated as espresso. Co-taster Sean Kohmescher (94) and Ken (94) both admired this sample’s refined complexity and chocolate-toned depth. Ken cited crisp fir and lemon complication, whereas Sean’s reading of nuance inclined more toward berry and wine. Both found the sample slightly more impressive in the small cup than in milk, but nevertheless honored its sweet chocolaty balance in two parts milk, nuanced (for Ken) by hints of flowers and lemon."
"El Patron Nicaragua Espresso"|"Las Chicas Del Café"|"94"|"London"|"Ontario"|"Nicaragua"|"Nicaragua"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Dark"|"Evaluated as espresso. Great depth and range of sensation. Between Ken (94) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (94) about a dozen aroma/flavor descriptors surfaced, most circling around fruit (stone fruit, wine grape, berry) and nut-toned dark chocolate. Medium to full body; silky/syrupy mouthfeel; crisply dry, flavor-saturated finish. Balanced, chocolaty and berryish in two parts milk."
"Guatemala La Conception"|"Terroir Coffee"|"95"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Chimaltenango Department, Guatemala"|"Guatemala"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Aromatics expand and deepen in subtle but extraordinary flavor and finish: buttery milk chocolate; sweet, lily-like flowers; ripe orange, all resonating in a long, impeccably clean but rich finish. Round, vibrant acidity; syrupy mouthfeel."
"Kenya Ndiara"|"Terroir Coffee"|"94"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Kirinyaga region, south-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Complex and almost giddily sweet-toned. Flowers, crisp blackcurrant, lemon, blackberry, roasted nut carry from aroma to cup. Sweetly tart, refined acidity; light body but very smooth, silky mouthfeel. Resonant, flavor-saturated short finish simplifies just a bit in the long."
"Burundi Kiryama"|"Terroir Coffee"|"92"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Northern Burundi"|"Burundi"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Low-toned, balanced aroma: nut, ripe citrus, flowers. Tart, lemony acidity; lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Aromatics turn rounder and riper in the cup: sweet citrus, gently tart berry, nut-toned cocoa. The cocoa and lemon in particular linger in a rich, clean finish."
"Colombian Huila Suaza Coocentral Cooperative"|"Fratello Coffee Roasters"|"92"|"Calgary"|"Alberta"|"Huila Department, Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"Crisp, delicately bright aroma: orange, a hint of apricot.

"Organic Ethiopia Yirgacheffe YCFCU"|"Lexington Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Lexington"|"Virginia"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Lemon-zest brightness and pungent fir in the aroma. The lemony character rounds in the acidity and the cup, where it is deepened and complicated by a crisp, floral-toned cocoa. Light but smoothly silky mouthfeel; cleanly sweet and flavor-saturated finish."
"Sumatra Mandheling Wahana Estate"|"Lexington Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Lexington"|"Virginia"|"Northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"Very complex, rather edgy Sumatra. Pruny dark chocolate, cherry, brandy, fir in the aroma. Quietly rich acidity; full, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Woody, sweet, herby character in the cup, reminiscent of sassafras perhaps. Floral top notes, continuing dark chocolate and cherryish fruit. Very sweet in the finish, with ongoing floral and wood notes."
"Tanzania Peaberry Tudeley Estate"|"Atomic Cafe Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Salem"|"Massachusetts"|"Mt. Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania"|"Tanzania"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Pungently sweet aroma: ripe lemony citrus, backgrounded nut. Round, soft acidity, medium body, lightly syrupy mouthfeel.

"Colombia La Escuelita"|"Coava Coffee Roasters"|"95"|"Portland"|"Oregon"|"Huila Department, Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"Quiet introduction: soft notes of fir, flowers and milk chocolate in the aroma. All of this soars in the cup, intense yet perfectly balanced. The floral notes, which take back seat to the milk chocolate and gently pungent fir in the cup, move forward again in a very sweet, clean finish. Delicately tart acidity, silky mouthfeel."
"Colombia Progreso"|"Coava Coffee Roasters"|"93"|"Portland"|"Oregon"|"Huila Department, Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"Crisply balanced with a shifting, tight-knit complexity. Flowers, nut, fir, and a dark chocolaty fruit in aroma and cup.  The flowers and chocolate carry long into the finish. Gentle acidity, silkily smooth mouthfeel."
"Burundi Kayanza Gatore Lot 3"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"91"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"Kayanza Province, Burundi"|"Burundi"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Brightly acidy and authoritative. Citrus- and floral-toned aroma broadens and deepens in the cup, taking on a tartly sweet mandarin orange-like quality. Intense, flower-toned acidity. The sweet citrus character gently lingers far into the long finish."
"Java Blawan Estate"|"Mystic Monk Coffee"|"89"|"Clark"|"Wyoming"|"Eastern Java"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Dark"|"A tactful dark roast develops sweetness and a pungent depth in a subtly complex coffee.

"Senseo Colombian (paper pod)"|"Douwe Egberts"|"76"|"Downers Grove"|"Illinois"|"Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"(As brewed in a Senseo single-serve brewing device to produce a 4+-ounce serving): Good sweetness, but otherwise muted acidity, lean mouthfeel, woody flavor with a soapy/salty edge, empty finish. Probably produced from a mildly defective green coffee, with the mildly medicinal character of the coffee intensified by the tendency of pod brewing generally and our sample Senseo machine in particular to mute aromatics."
"Sumatra Blend (Senseo Pod)"|"Douwe Egberts"|"83"|"Downers Grove"|"Illinois"|"Sumatra, Indonesia; other undisclosed origins"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"(As brewed in a Senseo single-serve brewing device to produce a 4+-ounce serving): Some genuine Sumatra character lifts its head out of a woody astringency probably related to paper pod brewing generally and the water quality of our sample Senseo machine in particular. On the positive side, pruny sweetness and a hint of earthy, butterscotchy Sumatra pungency in aroma and cup."
"Indriya (Nespresso capsule)"|"Nespresso"|"87"|"Lausanne"|"Switzerland"|"India"|"India"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"(As brewed in a Nespresso single-serve brewing device to produce a 4-ounce serving): This blend was designed for brewing as espresso rather than a longer black coffee, accounting for the dullish acidity, but otherwise impressive in the 4-ounce format: round, deep, chocolate-and roasted-nut-toned in aroma and cup; fat body and smooth mouthfeel. Flavor fades in an otherwise sweet, rich finish."
"Colombian LIght Roast (paper pod)"|"Baronet Coffee Roasters"|"88"|"Hartford"|"Connecticut"|"Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"(As brewed in a Bunn My Café single-serve brewing device to produce a 6-ounce serving): Rather lively, savory-sweet profile with ripe tomato and dark chocolate suggestions carrying from aroma through cup to finish.

Rich, buttery aroma: ripe lemon, cherry, a hint of fresh-cut fir. In the small cup medium body, smooth mouthfeel, crisply complex flavor: the fruit and fir notes resolve toward a dark chocolate with a hint of anise. Deep, sweet, dark-chocolaty finish. The chocolate sensation rounds and softens in two parts milk; think a lemon-toned milk chocolate."

For Wendy the acidity was “mild and fruity.” Fullish body, though Ken found the mouthfeel slightly lean."
"El Salvador Finca Los Planes Lote La Lagunita"|"Cartel Coffee Lab"|"88"|"Tempe"|"Arizona"|"Chalatenango Department, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Some difference emerged here between co-cupper Wendy De Jong (87) and Ken (89). The main divergence may have been owing to roast; Ken apparently tolerates lighter roasts more than Wendy does, who observes s “This super clean and bright coffee finished with a slight grainy note and thinness that could be addressed by more roasting experiments.” Ken, on the other hand, found pungent berry and tart cherry notes that for him reflected the fresh, pleasing flavor of the coffee fruit itself as framed by the lightish roast. There was some agreement, however: on the up side both Wendy and Ken praised the cleanly tart character, silky mouthfeel and solid finish; on the down both found some hints of fading in the green coffee."
"Costa Rican Calle de Copey"|"Fratello Coffee Roasters"|"89"|"Calgary"|"Alberta"|"Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica"|"Costa_Rica"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Deep, balanced, with a round, low-acid fruit that struck co-cupper Wendy De Jong (89) as cherry in the nose and melon and ripe pineapple in the cup, while Ken (89) read a fruit-toned chocolate in both. Wendy joined him in the chocolate camp (“milk chocolate”) for the finish. Both found the acidity quiet, the mouthfeel plush."
"Bolivian Café Central"|"Fratello Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Calgary"|"Alberta"|"Caranavi growing region, Bolivia"|"Bolivia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"A deep, sweet-toned complexity with some roast influence provoked differing yet overlapping descriptors from co-cupper Wendy De Jong (89) and Ken (91). Wendy found “stewed apple” and “ripe black plums and licorice” in aroma and cup respectively, while Ken (91) found blackberry, cocoa, and a delicate but distinct hint of flowers. The soft, balanced acidity was a bit too soft for Wendy (7) though Ken (8) found it nicely supported the general low-toned richness of the profile. Both responded positively to a smooth, lightly syrupy mouthfeel and sweet finish."
"Bolivia Flor Rosa COE 29"|"Barefoot Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Santa Clara"|"California"|"Caranavi growing region, Bolivia"|"Bolivia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Both co-cupper Wendy De Jong (89) and Ken (90) found pleasingly and sweetly tart notes (coffee cherry for Wendy, ripe lemon for Ken) complemented by apricot-like stone fruit and a rounding milk chocolate in aroma and cup.

"El Salvador San Isidro"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Ahuachapan Department, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Dark"|"Nut and molasses-like sweetness in the understated aroma. “Heavy and smooth” (co-cupper Wendy De Jong 89) to “lightly syrupy” (Ken 90) mouthfeel. Balanced acidity. Both Wendy and Ken found low-acid fruit leaning toward dark chocolate in cup and finish, though their associations varied, from Ken’s simple “cherryish fruit” to Wendy’s evocative “apricot … mulled wine and apples.” Both agreed that this coffee stayed on the rich side of astringency in the sweet, chocolate-toned finish."
"El Salvador La Pinera"|"Java Blend Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Halifax"|"Nova Scotia"|"San Miguel Department, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Co-cupper Wendy De Jong (92) admired this coffee’s savory depth more than Ken (90) did. Wendy: “floral and herbal aroma with dark cocoa. Complex flavors of savory herbs, sweet tomatoes, lemongrass and sweet stewed fruits.” Ken wanted a bit more brightness and shimmer. Both appreciated an acidity that was “rich” for Ken and “well-structured” for Wendy. Both commended a “creamy and supple” (Wendy) mouthfeel. “Sophisticated and lovely coffee gracefully roasted” Wendy concluded."
"Honduras Fernandez Farm"|"Café Grumpy"|"94"|"Brooklyn"|"New York"|"Santa Barbara Department, Honduras"|"Honduras"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Symphonically fruit-toned and shimmeringly bright. An “underlying crushed grape sweetness” (co-cupper Wendy De Jong, 94) supported an array of lemon and berry suggestions. Ken (94) found deepening hints of fresh-cut fir and dark chocolate as well. Forward but accessible acidity, silky mouthfeel, sweetly tart finish."

In the small cup some citrusy brightness, but the main sensory excitement is provided by pungent aromatic wood and savory anise notes with a deep backgrounded dark chocolate.

A very light roast develops brightness in the cup and simple but delicately nuanced flavors. Flowers and lime at first, deepening and sweetening to round, milky chocolate, with a gently smooth mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly, with a mild hint of sweet chocolate."
"Sumatra Peaberry Blue Batak Tarbarita"|"JBC Coffee Roasters"|"92"|"Madison"|"Wisconsin"|"Northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Plenty of sweet aromatic wood and soft fruit-tones in the aroma, with a hint of honey.

"El Salvador Natural Santa Rita"|"Atomic Cafe Coffee Roasters"|"89"|"Beverly"|"Massachusetts"|"Ahuachapan Department, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"A very slight fruit ferment both complicates and shadows the profile. A distinct orange-toned citrus and nut character dominates the aroma. In the cup round-toned acidity, syrupy mouthfeel, continued orange and nut notes sweeten and add a cocoa crispness.

"Ethiopia Organic Wondo Bonko"|"Klatch Coffee"|"90"|"San Dimas"|"California"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Light"|"A rather wild fruit ferment reads in the aroma as deep-toned cherryish fruit with complicating hints of lemon and aromatic wood. In the cup muted acidity, fullish body, and a complexly savory-sweet fruit character suggesting brandy, cherry, and a slightly salty chocolate. Softens in a long, salty-sweet finish."

"Organic Bolivia CENAPROC Cooperative"|"Kickapoo Coffee"|"90"|"Viroqua"|"Wisconsin"|"Caranavi growing region, Bolivia"|"Bolivia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"Nut, flowers and blackberryish fruit in the balanced though slightly muted aroma.

In the cup deeply acidy, full-bodied. The chocolate character deepens and sheds some fruit, but remains rich, sweet and buttery, with a slight herby/salty edge. The chocolate fruit outlasts a slight astringency in the finish."
"El Salvador Siberia"|"Flying Goat Coffee"|"92"|"Healdsburg"|"California"|"Santa Ana Department, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Complete and classic Central-American style cup, lively and delicately complex. Cherryish-chocolate fruit and a shimmering hint of flowers in the aroma. In the cup gentle acidity, tart cherry and milk chocolate notes, continuing hint of flowers.

"El Salvador Finca Kilimanjaro"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"89"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"Santa Ana Department, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Plush, extravagant fruit aromatics. Co-cupper Andy Newbom (89) praised the “absolutely glorious citrus and heavy florals” in the aroma; Ken (88) a – “lush fruit, flowers, a hint of cocoa.” For both the acidity was delicate and clean, the mouthfeel “buttery” (Andy). Andy energetically reported on flavor: “high notes of lemon and grapefruit that explode into raw cocoa.” However, both Ken and Andy found a slight hard sensation haunting cup and finish, dampening the explosive aromatics."
"Don Rey’s Private Reserve Bourbon, City Roast"|"Las Chicas Del Cafe"|"89"|"London"|"Ontario"|"Nicaragua"|"Nicaragua"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Enthusiastic co-cupper Andy Newbom (89) found this deep, chocolate-leaning coffee luxurious (“sweet and heavy lidded aroma”), balanced (“all-over tongue-hugger”), and complex (“smooth and sultry dark chocolate … with a hint of lemon/orange and a dash of florals).”  Ken (88) noted a pungent fruit that definitely suggested a nut- and peach-toned dark chocolate, but found a bit less complexity than did Andy."
"Kenya AA Neguguini Estate"|"Wicked Joe"|"89"|"Brunswick"|"Maine"|"South-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"Co-cupper Andy Newbom (91) found much to praise (and describe) in this “complex and serious” (Andy) coffee: spice, vanilla and chocolate in the aroma, peach and grape influence in the balanced acidity, more spice and molasses together with lemon and orange zest notes in the cup. “Full and sensual” mouthfeel. Ken’s (88) notes suggest he agreed with Andy on the seriousness of this coffee but harbored some reservations about its complexity. Ken found it “crisp, quiet, intense,” with night flowers and dry berry notes in the cup and a simple though rich finish."
"Manzano Blend El Salvador"|"Topeca Coffee Roasters"|"89"|"Tulsa"|"Oklahoma"|"Santa Ana Department, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"For co-cupper Andy Newbom (88) “dried peaches and a hint of prunes struggle to open into dark chocolate” in the cup. For Ken (89) the sweet dried fruit notes actually make it to dark chocolate, albeit a “berry-toned” version. Similarly, Ken tastes the good side of the finish, citing “long, deep, dry berry notes,” whereas for Andy an attractive “dried fruit sweetness” in the finish was compromised by “hard mineral fruit notes.” Both noted a “soft citrus” [Andy] acidity and a full but slightly rough mouthfeel."
"El Salvador Las Mercedes"|"Klatch Coffee"|"89"|"San Dimas"|"California"|"Usulutan Department, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Light"|"For Ken (90) and co-cupper Andy Newbom (88) “A classic and lovely El Salvador Bourbon with an intriguing twist at the end” (Andy). Pre-twist, Ken’s more general descriptions emphasize dry raisiny fruit, nut, and flowers, whereas Andy’s descriptors are more specific, not to mention more extravagant: “sweet dried nectarines and hibiscus” in the aroma, “flavors of stone fruits with apricot leading, hints of yellow pear and apple, a touch of soft lemonosity” in the cup, “honey … chocolate … peach” in the finish. As the cup cooled the twist at the end emerged. The hints of nut that Ken cited blossomed into a very explicit, dominating nut character with notes that Andy identified as “cashew and almond.”"
"Costa Rica La Legua de Aserri Don Mayo Estate"|"Bull Run Roasting"|"90"|"Minneapolis"|"Minnesota"|"Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica"|"Costa_Rica"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"“It’s sweet,” reports co-cupper Andy Newbom (90); Ken (90) agrees, though Ken is most impressed by the way sweetness is balanced by a deep pungency. Perhaps that’s what Andy is describing when he cites “Warm peaches and apple blossoms with hints of dark cherry” in the aroma. Lemon figures prominently in Andy’s descriptors of acidity and cup, tart berry in Ken’s. Both find suggestions of cocoa nibs, chocolate, and cassis. Andy finds “an intriguing lavender … note” in a finish that Ken describes more generally as “sweet, rich and deep.”"
"Colombia Supremo"|"Barrington Coffee Roasting Co."|"90"|"Lee"|"Massachusetts"|"Bucaramanga growing region, Santander Department, Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Light"|"Both co-cupper Andy Newbom (90) and Ken (90) emphasized the crisp acidity and balanced structure of this aromatically rather quiet coffee. “Exquisite crisp green-apple acidity with a touch of kiwi skin” and a “nicely smooth mouthfeel with a bit of a fruit leather feeling” for Andy, who found the green apple carrying into the flavor. For Ken the gently acidy tendency in the flavor suggested dry berry and lemon; both Andy and Ken noted a hint of cocoa nib, a vegetable-toned chocolate. More green apple in the finish for Andy while Ken simply describes a pleasing tart sweetness."
"Kenya AA Gatina"|"Flying Goat Coffee"|"92"|"Healdsburg"|"California"|"South-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Co-cupper Andy Newbom (92) and Ken (91) both found ways to admire this Kenya. Andy’s descriptors circle enthusiastically around flowers and citrus; “gardenia and lemon-blossom” in the aroma, “pears – orange butter and complex mild citrus” together with “gardenia and rose” in the cup. Ken reported parallel, if more generalized, descriptors of black currant, blackberry and hints of lemon, aromatic wood and night flowers. The mouthfeel was “fat and silky” for Ken, “creamy and fruity” for Andy. Ken was slightly disappointed by what he felt was a slight astringent imbalance in the finish, which for Andy was “long … smooth and lingered romantically.”"
"El Salvador Los Planes Peaberry de la Lagunita"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"93"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"Chalatenango Department, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Both Ken (93) and co-cupper Andy Newbom (92) admired the deep, profoundly fruit-toned character of this coffee. “Very sweet, richly but discreetly fruity coffee” for Ken, displaying “butter, honey, nut, aromatic wood, night flowers, a hint of herb.” Andy read more excitement and less discretion in the fruit character, in which (prepare yourself) “a menage a trois of raisins, dates and butterscotch got together with tangerine, clover honey and some lemons and raspberries and threw the sexiest block part ever.” Incidentally, sweetly bright acidity, “round and juicy” (Andy) mouthfeel, and a finish that resolved the profile with profound sweetness and “the slightest hint of savory complexity” (also Andy)."
"Kenya AA Kiru"|"Willoughby's Coffee & Tea"|"93"|"Branford"|"Connecticut"|"South-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Light"|"Same admiring scores from Ken (93) and co-cupper Andy Newbom (93) for this smoothly complete, complexly balanced coffee. “Sweet fruit and spice” in the aroma for Andy, which provokes ideas of “stewed jasmine and apricots.” Ken finds flowers and apricot also, along with a little pungent note he calls butterscotch. The acidity is “smoothly delicate” for Ken, “luxurious and suave” for Andy, who suggests the acidity “combined the best of both red and golden apples.” Refined flavor with a fine balance of dry and sweet fruit tones. Andy elaborates with an avalanche of allusions to apricot, casaba melon and “touches of red currant and candied grapefruit.” Rich, deep, “long and glorious” (Andy) finish."
"Costa Rica San Marcos Micro-Lot"|"Paradise Roasters"|"93"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica"|"Costa_Rica"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Light"|"Co-cupper Andy Newbom (94) admired this pungent yet lushly sweet Bourbon slightly more than Ken (92) did. Certainly Andy found more ways to describe its engaging contrast of lush sweetness and almost savory spice. For Andy “root beer, lemon peel” in the aroma, “fruit leather” in the acidity; a “complex blend of tangerine and cinnamon oil, clarified butter and sweet red pepper rounding into guava and gooseberry” in the cup, plus “hints of cocoa nib.” The finish impressively resolved the pungent/sweet paradox running through the profile: “astoundingly clear and bell-toned” for Andy; “long, sweetly flavor-saturated” for Ken."
"Ka’u Bourbon"|"Rusty's Hawaiian Coffee"|"95"|"Pahala"|"Hawaii"|"Ka'u growing district, southwestern corner of the ""Big Island"" of Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium"|"“An absolutely mind-blowing coffee” for co-cupper Andy Newbom (93). “Utterly pure yet soaringly intense,” for Ken (97). “Say fruit ten times,” Andy reports, and then he does, mainly variations of grapefruit, apricot and melon with green apple and Bartlett pear thrown in for the finish. For Ken that entire nuance is wrapped up in the extraordinary, singular explosion of cedary, pungently sweet berry, the quintessential Bourbon character. The acidity is enveloped in sweetness; in Andy’s colorful language it “startles and snuggles all at once.” For mouthfeel Andy suggests “crème fra&icirc;che Meyer lemon chiffon”; Ken sticks with a pedestrian “syrupy.” Ken awarded a perfect 10 to the long, balanced, deeply flavor-saturated finish."
"Doi Chaang Wild Civet Coffee"|"Doi Chaang Coffee"|"90"|"Calgary"|"Alberta"|"Northern Thailand"|"Thailand"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Light"|"Intriguing mid-tones throughout the profile: mainly a sort of orangy, floral citrus with a backgrounded complex simultaneously suggesting fresh earth, mushroom and decomposing leaves. All of this takes on a vaguely chocolaty tone in the finish. Gently smooth acidity, medium body."
"Kenya AA Lenana"|"Après Coffee"|"92"|"Lancaster"|"Pennsylvania"|"South-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"Rich, very intense aroma: dark chocolate, aromatic wood, nut, hints of citrus: orange, tangerine. The cup is influenced by a moderately dark roast, which nicely rounds acidity and turns the celebrated Kenya dry berry notes toward a crisply sweet cocoa or dark chocolate, with a continued shimmer of citrus. The berry-toned chocolate carries into a simple, rich finish. The only limitation of this graceful coffee is a lean, almost thin mouthfeel, though that could be admired as another expression of its complex delicacy."
"Mele 100% Kona Coffee"|"Hula Daddy"|"92"|"Holualoa"|"Hawaii"|"Holualoa, North Kona growing district, Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium-Light"|"An exciting, rather unusual complex of sweet but pungent citrus, nut and flowers animates the profile from aroma through finish. The citrus in particular is complex and engaging, one moment suggesting Meyer lemon, another especially sweet grapefruit. One cup of five we sampled displayed a very slight hint of bitterness; otherwise the rating for this exotic coffee would go higher."
"Kenya Peaberry Thika Gethumbwini"|"JBC Coffee Roasters"|"96"|"Madison"|"Wisconsin"|"South-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Light"|"Clean, complex, impeccable. Exhilaratingly dominated by crisp, nut-toned dry berry (blackberry, ripe black currant) in aroma and cup. Lush, lightly wine-toned acidity; medium body; syrupy mouthfeel. The underlying sweetness in the cup carries into the long, flavor-permeated finish."
"Kenya Gititu Peaberry"|"Atomic Cafe Coffee Roasters"|"92"|"Beverly"|"Massachusetts"|"South-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Rich, complex fruit aroma, intensely sweet and full. Roundly balanced acidity, smooth body, with a hint of floral and fruit tones expanding in the cup: sweet citrus, berries, currants. A mildly astringent mouthfeel carries into the lightly bittersweet chocolate-toned finish."
"Rwanda Ikawa"|"Counter Culture Coffee"|"90"|"Durham"|"North Carolina"|"Butare, southern Rwanda"|"Rwanda"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (88): “This coffee had a complex, well-balanced aroma that reminded me of a vanilla flower, although I?ve never smelled a vanilla flower. I wish more of this had carried over into the cup, because the flavor was not as complex [nor] as interesting.” Ken (92), on the other hand, found the floral and prune-toned fruit character of the aroma carried well into the cup, joined by cocoa and a slight, not unpleasant, salt or savory note. Ken and Jim agreed, however, in praising the richly resonant finish."
"Rwanda Coopac Cooperative"|"Kickapoo Coffee"|"90"|"Viroqua"|"Wisconsin"|"Rwanda"|"Rwanda"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Balanced, pungent character – “smoky and nutty” for co-cupper Jim Reynolds (89), “prune, nut, aromatic wood” for Ken (90) with rich floral hints. Smooth mouthfeel, round, rich finish."
"Burundi"|"Kean Coffee"|"90"|"Newport Beach"|"California"|"Kayanza Province, Burundi"|"Burundi"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Rich, low-toned, deceptively simple coffee. Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (89) found it a quietly complete cup, though “somewhat shy” in acidity. Both Jim and Ken (90) wrestled with a very slight hint of what cuppers call “bagginess,” a faint mildewed note that appears in coffees that have suffered exposure to too much moisture during shipment or storage. The coffee’s essential richness and floral cocoa tendencies overcame this shadow note, however, allowing the underlying beauty of the coffee to resonate in cup and long, flavor-saturated finish."
"Burundi Bwayi Lot 5"|"Paradise Roasters"|"90"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"Kayanza Province, Burundi"|"Burundi"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"For co-cupper Jim Reynolds (89) a smooth and essentially complete cup but too subdued, with “unassertive acidity.” Ken (90) found the cup quiet as well, but enjoyed floral, apricot, chocolate, possibly butter notes in aroma and cup, with an acidity that was richly red-wine-like."
"Rwanda Bufcoffee Nyarusiza"|"The Roasterie"|"90"|"Kansas City"|"Missouri"|"Nyamagabe, South Province, Rwanda"|"Rwanda"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (91) praised a “spicy pungency” in the aroma and a smooth, balanced acidity. Ken (89) agreed. Both found the pungent character carrying into the cup, complicated for Ken by hints of flowers and cocoa. Simple but satisfying finish. Jim found the body “balanced in the light to medium range” but Ken found the mouthfeel a bit lean, accounting for his somewhat lower score."
"Tanzania Hope Peaberry"|"49th Parallel Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Burnaby"|"British Colombia"|"Mbeya Region, southwestern Tanzania"|"Tanzania"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Both co-cupper Jim Reynolds (90) and Ken (91) described a very sweet-toned aroma and pleasingly delicate acidity, which Ken glossed as “wine-toned.” Lightly syrupy mouthfeel, clean and balanced in flavor, “nutty” for Jim, tartly fruity and floral for Ken. Very sweet-finishing."
"Rwanda Kabuye Cooperative Full Flavor Roast"|"Terroir Coffee"|"92"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Huye, South Province, Rwanda"|"Rwanda"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Ken (93) favored this coffee considerably more than did co-cupper Jim Reynolds (89) despite the fact that both described it in similar terms. Ken was taken by floral qualities in aroma and cup, an essential sweetness, and what he called a complimentary “cocoaish dry fruit,” doubtless the same sensation as Jim describes positively as “pungent” and “spicy and nutty.” Both agreed that the acidity was gentle, though Ken scored it higher and described it as “crisp and sweet.” Both found the mouthfeel attractively smooth and the finish long and flavor-saturated."
"Rwanda COE Lot 16"|"Bull Run Roasting"|"92"|"Minneapolis"|"Minnesota"|"Huye, South Province, Rwanda"|"Rwanda"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Ken (92) particularly admired this coffee’s deep, night-blossoming floral character which he felt was balanced by an underlying crisp, cedary cocoa. Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (91) found the profile “mild” and caramelly with a soft ? for Jim, a bit too soft ? acidity."
"Rwandan"|"Zingerman's Coffee"|"93"|"Ann Arbor"|"Michigan"|"Rwanda"|"Rwanda"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"Co-cupper Jim Reynolds and Ken both admired this coffee, but Ken, at 90, was less admiring than Jim at 95. Essentially, Jim found everything he wanted in an African coffee of this style – a combination of complexity, balance and deep dimension – whereas Ken liked what he found but wanted more of it, more intensity and a more pronounced, distinctive character. Both admired a bright, citrusy but delicate acidity, silky mouthfeel, and a mildly pungent chocolate that Jim described as “smoky chocolate” and Ken as “cocoa and aromatic wood.” Jim found the aftertaste “lingering,” Ken found it pleasing but short."
"Burundi Bwayi Lot No. 8"|"Counter Culture Coffee"|"93"|"Durham"|"North Carolina"|"Kayanza Province, Burundi"|"Burundi"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Both co-cupper Jim Reynolds (94) and Ken (91) particularly admired the “active acidity” (Jim) of this coffee with its rich berry and floral influences. Jim found the flavor “complex but balanced.” Ken was more specific: “dark chocolate, cherryish fruit, a hint of dusk flowers.” Both approved of mouthfeel (“lightly syrupy,” Ken) and finish (“light, bright and very pleasant,” Jim)."
"Tanzania Karmaro Micro-Lot"|"49th Parallel Coffee Roasters"|"93"|"Burnaby"|"British Colombia"|"Mbeya Region, southwestern Tanzania"|"Tanzania"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (92) admired the “spicy, floral qualities” of this coffee, as did Ken (94), who found blackberry and spicy rose in both aroma and cup. A medium-bodied coffee, but both Jim and Ken remarked on the impressively smooth mouthfeel. Ken showed perhaps a bit more admiration for delicate poise of this coffee, which may account for his higher score."
"Burundi Kinyovu"|"Kaldi's Coffee Roasting"|"95"|"St. Louis"|"Missouri"|"Kayanza Province, Burundi"|"Burundi"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (95): “This coffee scored well in every category. I especially liked the floral acidity – a nice vanilla and chocolate aspect to the flavor complemented the smooth – very smooth – mouthfeel.” Ken’s praise (94) was nearly identical, though he added “spicy fruit” and a hint of lemon to his descriptors. Impressive flavor persistence in a long, rich finish."
"Colombia Las Mingas Micro-Lot – Anival Gomez"|"Bird Rock Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"La Jolla"|"California"|"Cauca Department, south-western Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"The aroma is sweet-toned and alive with flowers, ripe tomato, a hint of cedar; the mouthfeel silky. The issue in the cup is the acidity, sweet but intense, all but sidelining delicate cocoa and floral notes and carrying with dry authority into the finish."
"Sumatra Blue Batak"|"JBC Coffee Roasters"|"92"|"Madison"|"Wisconsin"|"Northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Light"|"Sweet-toned aromatic wood and roundly fruity aroma, with hints that suggest coconut. Medium to full body, soft mouthfeel, balanced acidity, and a complex range of flavors – grapefruit, lime, coconut, sweet table grapes, aromatic wood and a suggestion of flowers.

"Espresso Blend #1"|"Zingerman's Coffee"|"91"|"Ann Arbor"|"Michigan"|"Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Co-taster Byron Holcomb (92) found more going on aromatically in this poised, balanced espresso than did Ken (89). Byron: “Aroma notes of brandy, honey and walnut yielded [to] flavors of passion fruit and orange bitters. The aftertaste was ? dry with notes of bakers’ cocoa. In milk, some of the great spice notes showed: cinnamon, coriander, allspice.”"
"Harazi Yemen"|"Maskal Fine Coffee"|"88"|"Bochingen"|"Germany"|"Harazi growing region, north-central Yemen"|"Yemen"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"Notes of fermented fruit (berry?), chocolate and aromatic wood carry from a rich, sweet-toned aroma into the cup, where they turn muted and rather heavy, though they preserve their concentrated fruit and a halo of chocolaty sweetness. Chocolate notes sustain in a long, relatively astringent finish."
"Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Beloya Selection 8"|"Barrington Coffee Roasting Co."|"95"|"Lee"|"Massachusetts"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Light"|"Grandly fruity and sweetly fermented profile: port wine, raisiny dark chocolate, night flowers, blueberry, all carry with giddy intensity from aroma through cup to the long finish. Wine-like acidity, syrupy body, deep sweetness."
"S.O. Espresso India CxR"|"Paradise Roasters"|"90"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"Southern India"|"India"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Light"|"Deep aroma: sweet nut, hints of orange, toast and vanilla. Smooth, buttery mouthfeel and pungent flavors of cedar, more orange and caramel, toasted grains and a hint of flowers. The sweet nut tone returns in the finish. The subtle flavors found in the small cup turn subdued in milk, limited to a mild, milky chocolate and toasted nut; finishing with a fine sweetness but a hint of astringency."
"Organic Papua New Guinea Purosa A"|"Supreme Bean Coffee Roasters"|"86"|"North Hollywood"|"California"|"Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Light"|"The difference between co-cupper Jennifer Stone?s score of 84 and Ken’s 89 depended on how they responded to a shadow fault in an otherwise impressive, complex coffee. The fault emerged as the coffee cooled; Jennifer simply called it an “off” note; Ken described it as vaguely metallic though very faint. Slight fault aside, this is a classic South Pacific profile, gently pungent with aromatic wood and nut notes softened by hints of bananaish fruit and night flowers."
"Organic Papua New Guinea"|"Apres Coffee"|"88"|"Lancaster"|"Pennsylvania"|"Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"NA"|"Notes:"
"Papua New Guinea Purosa Fair-Trade Organic"|"Sweetwater Organic Coffee Roasters"|"89"|"Gainesville"|"Florida"|"Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Both co-cupper Jennifer Stone (88) and Ken (90) remark on a distinct natural sweetness running from aroma through a gentle acidity to a long, resonant finish. Ken found more to remark on in regard to aromatic and flavor notes: nut and a hint of milk chocolate in the aroma, a more explicit chocolate in the cup, together with a hint of cherryish fruit. Delicate, rather lean mouthfeel."
"Papua New Guinea Light Roast"|"Camano Island Coffee Roasters"|"89"|"Camano Island"|"Washington"|"Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Crisp, straightforward coffee; co-cupper Jennifer Stone (89) was impressed by its full mouthfeel and rather deep dimension, Ken (88) by its general balance and poise. The pleasant but muted aromatics were difficult to sort out with any precision; Jennifer tended toward caramel and chocolate; Ken was more into nut. Lest that sounds too much like sundae toppings, these were crisp, bitter-sweet, coffee-contexted nuances."
"Papua New Guinea Kimel A"|"Jersey Shore Coffee Roasters"|"89"|"Leonardo"|"New Jersey"|"Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"Co-cupper Jennifer Stone (88) remarked on this coffee?s winy acidity and pungent flavor and aromatics; Ken (89) glossed pungent with references to spicy aromatic wood and backgrounded dark chocolate.

Co-cupper Jennifer Stone (90) remarks on the clean simplicity of the profile with perhaps a coffee romantic’s regret at a lack of aromatic intrigue; nevertheless, both Ken (91) and Jennifer found subtleties in the aromatics and flavor, with Ken reading sweet, subdued citrus and cocoa, Jennifer spicy stone fruit, and both remarking on the distinct floral notes. Softly assertive acidity, medium body, sweet finish."
"Papua New Guinea"|"California Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Del Valle"|"Texas"|"Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Light"|"Sweet-toned, foresty aroma; co-cupper Jennifer Stone (90) found flowering grass and herb; Ken (91) freshly cut wood and night flowers.

In the cup quietly vibrant acidity, smooth mouthfeel, continued gentle richness, with a flavor complex that combines lush night flowers with a sweet pungency pointing at cedar, caramel and deep-toned, carnal fruit: apricot, mango.

The sweet blueberry-like fruit prevails in the aroma, the fruit and savory herb balance in the cup. They split the difference in the finish: the short finish belongs to the fruit and chocolate, the long to the dry, herby mouthfeel."
"San Jose Ocana Guatemala"|"Flying Goat Coffee"|"90"|"Healdsberg"|"California"|"Sacatepequez region, Guatemala"|"Guatemala"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"A gently bright coffee, with a sweet-toned aroma: orange, blackberry and flowers.

A bright acidity is softened and rounded by faint suggestions of fruit. The balance continues in the cup with tart lime tones standing out in front, fading to a pleasant nuttiness.

"Colombian"|"Reading Coffee Roasters"|"89"|"Birdsboro"|"Pennsylvania"|"Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"Sweet-toned, bright aroma: gently pungent nut and fir notes, hints of coffee fruit (tart cherry), butter, chocolate.

"El Salvador Finca San Jose Cup of Excellence #10 Coffee"|"Barefoot Coffee Roasters"|"87"|"Santa Clara"|"California"|"Ahuachapan region, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"A light-roasted coffee rather too bright and lean-bodied to fulfill conventional expectations for espresso, though shimmeringly floral and citrusy throughout the profile. “Very clean and floral in the aroma” for co-taster Heather Perry (87). In the small cup refreshingly if rather sharply citrus, with “delicate butter and floral notes” (Ken, 87) that carry into an impressive, sweetly dry finish. The delicate floral and citrus profile fades in milk, however, retaining a tart sweetness but quite lean in mouthfeel."
"Bolivia Chicaloma Cup of Excellence 2007 Organic"|"Olympia Coffee Roasting"|"87"|"Olympia"|"Washington"|"Sud-Yungas region, Bolivia"|"Bolivia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Mouthfeel and presence trumped aromatics. Both co-taster Heather Perry (87) and Ken (87) admired smooth, lightly syrupy mouthfeel in the small cup and solid balance in milk. Aromatics were relatively subdued and simple, however: “spicy” with “light lemon undertones” for Heather, “smoky chocolate” with floral hints for Ken (87)."

But for both the mouthfeel was a bit lean in the small cup and the flavor a bit sharp, though Ken admired the continued floral notes. For both tasters the profile smoothed in the long finish, with a sweet flavor persistence that suggested chocolate for Ken, “blackberry pie” for Heather. Heather found it lost sweetness in milk but Ken was pleased, finding it crisp with “true chocolate” notes."
"Guatemala Finca El Injerto Espresso Roast"|"Pacific Bay Coffee Company"|"90"|"Berkeley"|"California"|"Huehuetenango growing region, Guatemala"|"Guatemala"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Dark"|"A simple, rich, roast-influenced espresso that particularly came into its own in milk. In the small cup deep, roundly dark-chocolate-toned aroma, full body, gently pungent flavor and finish with roast-influenced notes that co-taster Heather Perry (88) associated with herbs (particularly thyme) and Ken (91) with cedar, night flowers and black cherry. Heather was particularly impressed by this coffee’s performance in milk, where she found the herbal character she admired persisted “beautifully.”"
"Brazil Fazenda Sao Joao Espresso"|"Ecco Caffe"|"90"|"Santa Rosa"|"California"|"Coromandel growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Both Ken (90) co-taster Heather Perry (89) found this sample pleasingly and crisply fruity; “Meyer lemon” notes dominated for Heather, spicy floral and orange for Ken. Despite a tendency to express itself in floral and fruit notes, the shot maintained balance throughout and showed well in milk, with attractive hints of chocolate and (for Ken) spicy, rose-toned flowers."
"El Salvador Los Planes Single Origin Espresso"|"Stone Cup Roasting"|"90"|"Chattanooga"|"Tennessee"|"Citala region, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Both Ken (91) and co-taster Heather Perry remarked on a delicate, slightly pungent quality in both aroma and small cup that that Heather associated with herb and orange peel and Ken with cedar and orange. Medium-bodied, with a flavor-saturated finish. In milk both Heather and Ken found balance, with continued orange-toned and, for Ken, chocolaty nuance."
"Ethiopia Harar Moplaco Cooperative Boldgrain"|"Victrola Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Harrar (or Harar) growing region, eastern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"Flowers and tropical fruit in the sweet-toned aroma. For co-taster Heather Perry (88), “Floral notes turned to orange, berry, spice and cocoa, complex yet balanced and sweet” in the small cup. Ken (91) agreed. However, Heather found the shot in milk “very rough” whereas Ken liked it: “sweet, balanced, with a banana-toned chocolate.”"
"Organic Brazil Serra Do Bone"|"La Mill Coffee"|"91"|"Alhambra"|"California"|"Matas de Minas growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Fine straight-shot espresso. Rich in the aroma with a delicately pungent note Ken (91) called cedar and co-taster Heather Perry (90) spice. In the small cup dense and syrupy in mouthfeel with dark chocolate and continued spice and orangey cedar notes. Long, resonantly flavor-saturated finish. Loses some power and complexity, though it remains pleasantly drinkable and the orangey/spicy chocolate persists."
"Sable Espresso Zimbabwe"|"Leopard Forest Coffee"|"91"|"Travelers Rest"|"South Carolina"|"Eastern Highlands, Zimbabwe"|"Zimbabwe"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Complex, authoritative espresso. Ken (92) found dark chocolate and fresh leather notes in the aroma, co-taster Heather Perry (89) nut. Both remarked on an attractive bittersweet citrus character in the cup, which Heather nicely characterized as “blood orange.” Ken was particularly taken by the citrusy chocolate finish. But perhaps this coffee’s most remarkable performance was in milk, where the crisp fruit bloomed with round, chocolate- and berry-toned assurance."
"Panama Boquete Casa Ruiz"|"JBC Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Madison"|"Wisconsin"|"Boquete growing region, western Panama"|"Panama"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Crisply floral-toned aroma, caramel and pear-toned fruit notes, with a hint of cedary warmth. In the cup medium body with a lightly and pleasantly syrupy mouthfeel. A bright, pronounced acidity simplifies the aromatics when the cup is hot, but as it cools a delicate, tight-knit complexity emerges: hints of white wine, caramelly milk chocolate, continued pear-toned fruit. Clean, sweetly dry finish."
"Kenya Peaberry Ruera Estate"|"Atomic Cafe Coffee Roasters"|"96"|"Beverly"|"Massachusetts"|"South-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"Symphonically rich coffee of extraordinary elegance. Crisp dry berry notes of the kind often characterized as black currant, orange, nut, dusk flowers run through the profile from aroma to cup. Powerful acidity enveloped in sweetness, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. The black currant notes in particular carry into a long, pure, sweet-toned finish."
"Brazil Fazenda Cambara"|"Klatch Coffee"|"88"|"San Dimas"|"California"|"Carmo de Minas growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Sweet-toned aroma with fruit notes that Ken (88) read as banana and co-cupper Ted Stachura (88) as blackberry. In the cup fresh, delicate, with nut and continued fruit notes complicated by floral hints that Ken found just a touch grassy, a fault that for him carried into the otherwise clean, floral-toned finish."
"Brasil Cerrado Fazenda Sao Pedro Lot 307 Natural"|"Victrola Coffee Roasters"|"88"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"In the aroma cocoaish chocolate with floral top notes. In the cup Ken (89) and co-cupper Ted Stachura (87) both found continued baker’s chocolate notes with a lean toward nut. Complications for Ken were hints of flowers and white wine, for Ted faint suggestions of citrus and pipe tobacco. Round and chocolaty in the short finish, fading toward a mild astringency (Ted: “dry wood”) in the long."
"Brazil Cerrado"|"Greyfriar's Coffee and Tea"|"88"|"Chattanooga"|"Tennessee"|"Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Roasty notes in both aroma and cup: pungent cedar, dark chocolate, caramel. For co-cupper Ted Stachura (88) further hints of nut and pipe tobacco; for Ken (88) dusk flowers.

"Brazil Daterra Bourbon"|"Pacific Bay Coffee Company"|"88"|"Berkeley"|"California"|"Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"A very sweet-toned coffee with a balancing crisp pungency. Roasted nut notes turned up in aroma and cup for both Ken (89) and co-cupper Ted Stachura (86) with low-acid fruit notes that Ken read as raisin and Ted as cherry. Ken found cocoa and dusk-floral notes in both cup and finish, which perhaps accounts for his higher rating."

Dense, heavy presence in the cup. Both Ken (89) and co-cupper Ted Stachura (89) found bittersweet chocolate notes. Ted also noted nut, pipe tobacco, hints of leather. Long, nut-toned finish."
"Brazil Daterra Reserve Cerrado"|"Ecco Caffe"|"90"|"Santa Rosa"|"California"|"Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Co-cupper Ted Stachura (91) and Ken (88) both admired the honeyish, crisply fruit- and floral-influenced aroma. Ken, however, found the cup very slightly sharp with a mild but distracting astringency. Ted, however, had no complaints: “bright, tangy acidity with floral tones. Flavor: floral, sweet, [with] notes of tangerine and fruity white wine. Mild, nutty finish.”"
"Brazil Fazenda Cachoeira de Gramma Mogiana"|"Ecco Caffe"|"90"|"Santa Rosa"|"California"|"Mogiana growing region, Sao Paulo State, south-central Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Ken (91) was more attracted to this coffee’s sweet, deeply low-toned, big-bodied character than was co-cupper Ted Stachura (89), who found the dominant nut and bittersweet chocolate character marked by a hint of woodiness. But both cuppers describe a deep, dark-chocolaty, nutty coffee with a balancing hint of citrus and a rich if slightly heavy finish."
"Fazenda Sao Joao Brasil"|"Ritual Coffee Roasters"|"92"|"San Francisco"|"California"|"Coromandel growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Little difference in rating or description between Ken (92) and co-cupper Ted Stachura (91) in regard to this exceptional Brazil natural. Ted’s assessment: “Big, floral aroma – lavender, fruit and sweet-leaning white wine. Floral and fruit qualities carry into the bright, yet fine, acidity. Complex flavors with more floral upfront, subtle, tart citrus tones and lots of sweetness. Clean finish with lingering floral hints.”"
"Fazenda do Serrado Brasil"|"Ritual Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"San Francisco"|"California"|"Carmo de Minas growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Ken (91) was struck by the pungently sweet berry or black currant notes, which carry straight through from aroma through cup to finish. Co-cupper Ted Stachura (also 91) was a bit more general in his characterization, finding “sweet, winy tones and fruit” in the aroma and “bright acidity with floral qualities and sweet tangerine, cherry blossom and chocolate” in the cup. For both Ken and Ted the finish was slightly heavy but nevertheless pleasantly rich and flavor-saturated."
"Brasil Cerrado Fazenda Esperanca Lot 302 Pulped Natural"|"Victrola Coffee Roasters"|"92"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"In the aroma roasted nut and honey for co-cupper Ted Stachura (91), plum, cedar and nut for Ken (92). In the cup softly acidy, gently bittersweet, quietly complex: cocoa, roasted nut, (walnut for Ted), hints of flowers, citrus and plumy fruit. The cocoa turns chocolaty in a surprisingly rich finish."
"Brazil Fazenda Boa Vista"|"Klatch Coffee"|"94"|"San Dimas"|"California"|"Carmo de Minas growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Balanced, complex, complete. The quiet but assertive acidity was praised as “balanced” by co-cupper Ted Stachura (93) and “sweet, rich, integrated” by Ken (94). The mouthfeel was “juicy” (Ted), the aroma and cup showed a crisply sweet complex of dry berry, cocoa, flowers, citrus, nut. Long, deep, chocolate-toned finish."

"Rwanda Blue Bourbon Black Apron Exclusive"|"Starbucks Coffee"|"87"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Rwanda"|"Rwanda"|"Africa"|"Dark"|"A paradoxical coffee, thin and subdued, but with considerable suggestions of richness and complexity. In the aroma muted suggestions of night flowers, butter, black cherries. In the cup lean but silky mouthfeel and delicate hints of spicy nut, cocoa, more flowers and cherry, perhaps of a rather dullish aromatic wood. The flavor persists nicely into an otherwise short, fast-fading finish."

In the aroma the lushly fermented fruit reads as rich, cherryish chocolate with a hint of flowers and pungent cedar. In the cup gently acidy, medium bodied, crisply sweet with continued cherry- and chocolate-toned fruit and the bitterish rosemary note. Sweetness and chocolate prevail in the surprisingly clean finish."
"Colombia Micro-Lot Wilmer Delgado"|"Klatch Coffee"|"91"|"San Dimas"|"California"|"Cauca Department, southern Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"Explosive aromatics: In the break deep, rich, buttery and honey-like with suggestions of flowers, coffee fruit, fresh-tanned leather. In the cup the butter notes turn rather pungent, toward butterscotch with continued flowers and a fruit that softens toward milk chocolate. Medium bodied, slightly underpowered and short in the finish but intense and intriguing aromatics throughout."

"Decaffeinated Costa Rica"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"88"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"Costa Rica"|"Costa_Rica"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"A sweet-toned, gently acidy, lyric medium-roasted coffee struggling with the dampening impact of decaffeination. Orange, white wine, and temperate fruit notes, pear perhaps, almost succeed in soaring over a decaf woodiness."
"Decaf Harfusa Ethiopia Yirgacheffe"|"Counter Culture Coffee"|"90"|"Durham"|"North Carolina"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"A slight menthol-like astringency throughout the profile is the only restraint to this otherwise exceptional, complexly engaging coffee. In the aroma sweet-toned and balanced with pungent orange and butterscotch notes and hints of flowers and nut. The acidity is gentle and integrated, the cup very sweet but crisp in structure, with continued orange, nut, flower and very distinct cocoa or baker’s chocolate notes. The nut and floral notes carry into a rich finish, although the shadow tightness that nags its way through the cup has the last word as the nuts and flowers fade."
"Sumatra Lake Tawar Decaf"|"Paradise Roasters"|"92"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"Lake Tawar basin, Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"Sweetly pungent, nut-like in the aroma with hints of raisins and night flowers. In the cup medium in body with syrupy mouthfeel, very sweet in structure with continued pungent moist earth and grapefruit notes. Continued hints of raisin and night flowers. Cleanly rich, long finish."
"Mexico La Union Medium Roast"|"Pachamama Coffee Cooperative"|"90"|"Huatusco"|"Vera Cruz"|"Huatusco, Vera Cruz, Mexico"|"Mexico"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"NA"|"Sweetly balanced in aroma and cup: butter, flowers, orange, dark chocolate. The orangy chocolate notes dominate in the gently acidy, silky-bodied cup. Fine finish: rich, sweet, flavor-saturated. A very slight hint of astringency emerges as the cup cools."
"Sumatra Danau Toba"|"Paradise Roasters"|"96"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"Lake Toba region, North Sumatra Province, Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Light"|"Powerfully sweet throughout the profile, but without candyish sentiment. Moist leaves earth notes in the aroma with hints of flowers and grapefruit and pungently buttery notes that plausibly read as butterscotch. In the cup big-bodied with a backgrounded but vibrant acidity. Flavor is dominated by a lush, cherryish or grapey fruit with continuing hints of earth and butterscotch. The lush fruit and crisp earth together carry into the long, deep finish."
"Single Origin Medium Roast"|"Doi Chaang Coffee"|"90"|"Calgary"|"Alberta"|"Northern Thailand"|"Thailand"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Suave, impressively balanced coffee. Flower and orange notes in the aroma. In the cup softly acidy with a hint of white wine; medium in body but round in impression with continued floral and orange notes and a hint of milk chocolate. Clean, sweet finish."
"Colombia Huila Monserrate Excelso"|"Victrola Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Huila Department, Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Flowers run through the profile from aroma through finish, with smoky notes in the aroma, crisp chocolate in the roughly full-bodied cup and again in the rather heavy finish."
"Colombia Maragogipe Rainforest Alliance"|"Leopard Forest Coffee"|"90"|"Travelers Rest"|"South Carolina"|"Antioquia Department, central northwest Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"Lightly and sweetly acidy with delicately crisp floral, walnut and orange notes running from aroma through cup to the particularly impressive finish, where the sweetness peaks and the flavor notes consolidate and survive a slight tightness."
"Colombia Estrella del Sur"|"Batdorf & Bronson Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Olympia"|"Washington"|"Huila Department, Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Distinctly cocoa- and nut-toned aroma. In the cup softly acidy, medium-bodied, and very sweet with continued cocoa and nut notes. In the finish the cocoa deepens toward chocolate, softening a slight astringency."
"Colombian Breakfast Blend"|"Island Joe's Coffee"|"91"|"Key West"|"Florida"|"Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Very sweet-toned aroma: distinct cocoaish chocolate notes with hints of walnut and a black-cherry inclined fruit. In the cup the cocoa and walnut notes simplify and amplify, supported by a sweet, crisp acidity. Flavor fades rather quickly in the finish but the chocolate and walnut have the last word."
"Colombia Humbenito Gonzales"|"Stumptown Coffee Roasters"|"92"|"Portland"|"Oregon"|"Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Straightforward but very agreeable profile: Sweet cocoa and flower notes throughout, from a rather restrained aroma through balanced cup and rich, long finish. Sweet, acidity, solid body."
"Colombia La Golondrina Odair Achipiz Cauca"|"Counter Culture Coffee"|"92"|"Durham"|"North Carolina"|"Valle de Cauca Department, western Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"A quietly distinctive coffee that rewards attentiveness. Balanced, round, resonant in structure with restrained but pleasing aromatics: white wine, walnut, cedar, hints of flowers and chocolate. The chocolate tendencies amplify in an impressively rich finish."
"Colombia Tres Santos Micro-Lot El Portal"|"Intelligentsia Coffee"|"93"|"Chicago"|"Illinois"|"Valle de Cauca Department, western Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"Sweet-toned, crisply rich aroma with chocolate, cedar, flowers, ripe tomato notes.

"Reserva del Patron Colombia Narino"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"93"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"Narino Department, southern Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"Distinctive aromatics: sweetly dry fruit notes that suggest black current, blackberry, tart cherry, cedary orange.

"Colombia Micro-Lot Huila La Argentina"|"Willoughby's Coffee & Tea"|"93"|"Branford"|"Connecticut"|"Huila Department, Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Delicate but intense aroma, with milk chocolate, nut and coffee fruit notes that read as tart cherry. In the cup impressive balance and structure: lushly sweet but crisply acidy with a lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Continued tart cherry and chocolate notes carry into a simple but cleanly rich finish."
"Colombia Micro-Lot Humberto Gonzales"|"Klatch Coffee"|"93"|"San Dimas"|"California"|"Huila Department, Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"Richly sweet-toned aroma: orange, cocoa, butterscotch.

Elegantly balanced cup: softly acidy, silky in mouthfeel, with continued dried cherry, cocoaish chocolate and a slight brightening hint of lemon. The chocolate notes in particular carry into the long, rich, complex finish."
"Colombia Tolima Jairo Guiterrez Micro-Lot 07"|"Paradise Roasters"|"95"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"Tolima Department, east-central Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Intense, balanced aroma: cedar, cherry, flowers, orange. In the cup syrupy body with an almost bouillon-like richness, deeply but quietly acidy, with floral high notes and a wonderfully deep cherry- and cedar-toned chocolate. The pungent chocolate/fruit notes carry into a long, flavor-saturated finish."
"Organic Colombia"|"Kickapoo Coffee"|"95"|"Viroqua"|"Wisconsin"|"Fondo Paez Cooperative, Valle de Cauca Department, western Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Sweet-toned, delicately complex aroma: flowers, hints of honey, cedar and tart cherry, perhaps chocolate. In the cup very gently acidy, light in body but buoyant and silky in mouthfeel, and giddily floral- and honey-toned with complicating hints of chocolate, tart coffee fruit and Riesling-like white wine. Fades rather quickly in the finish but exquisitely clean with memories of chocolate and flowers. An exceptionally pure and balanced coffee."

"Sumatra Mandheling, South Italian Espresso Roast"|"Terroir Coffee"|"92"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Lintong growing region, North Sumatra Province, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"Rich, gently pungent aroma with butter, floral and apricot-toned fruit hints. In the small cup medium body, syrupy mouthfeel, and rather sharply but sweetly cedary with continued apricot and flowers and an explicit moist, leaves earth note. At its best in milk: rich, strong-presenced but sweet with dark chocolate and sustained suggestions of moist earth and flowers."
"Nectar"|"R Miguel"|"94"|"Anoka"|"Minnesota"|"Boquete growing region, western Panama"|"Panama"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Deep-toned aroma with great range and complexity: flowers, orange, cocoa, butter, cedar. In the cup richly acidy, medium in body, silky in mouthfeel, with continued lavender-like floral notes, crisp cocoa, dry berry. Clean, tartly juicy finish with flower notes present to the last fading."

"100% Colombia Dark Roast"|"Kirkland Signature (Costco)"|"83"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Low in acidity, with a sweet, mildly fermented fruit that struck me as a bit too cloyingly sweet (banana-ish fruit, cut flowers past their prime) in the aroma, but cleaner and more attractive in the cup (banana, slightly fresher flowers, syrupy mouthfeel) and especially in a rich, fruity, if mildly astringent finish."
"Organic Sumatra Fair-Trade, Medium Dark Roast"|"Trader Joe's"|"84"|"Pasadena"|"California"|"Northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"Intense, roundly balanced aroma with mildly pungent roast character and orange, nut and cedary chocolate notes. In the cup low in acidity, medium in body and agreeable but rather simple aromatically: bittersweet, woody, with only a hint of cedary, perhaps earthy, chocolate. Not a long finish, but sweet and rich."
"Rainforest Alliance Breakfast Blend"|"Marques de Paiva (Sam's Club)"|"86"|"Miami"|"Florida"|"Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Simple, rather shallow aroma but agreeably chocolate- and nut-toned. In the cup low in acidity, syrupy in mouthfeel, sweet-toned with continued nut and crisply cocoaish chocolate notes. In the finish fades rather quickly but on the way out remains cocoaish and rich."
"100% Tanzanian"|"Coffees of the World (Sam's Club)"|"86"|"San Francisco"|"California"|"Mt. Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania"|"Tanzania"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"A low-key but still distinctive cup: crisp, lean-bodied, with sweet blackberry, dry blackcurrant and pungently orange, nut and cedar notes. If it were not for a flavor-dampening undercurrent of wood this would be a 90-point coffee."
"Organic Medium Roast"|"Marques de Paiva (Sam's Club)"|"87"|"Miami"|"Florida"|"Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Sweet, crisp, simple with walnut and minty dark chocolate notes in the aroma that consolidate as a distinct, pleasing cocoa in the quietly balanced cup. The long, rich, cocoa-toned finish is particularly impressive."
"Barista Brava Sumatra"|"Quartermaine Coffee Roasters (Sam's Club)"|"88"|"Rockville"|"Maryland"|"Northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"In the aroma sweet, intense: molasses, dry berry, butter, earth. In the cup gently acidy, delicate but – again – intense, with continued molasses and cocoa-toned earth notes. A coffee both wild and elegant. Slight heaviness in the finish and slightly uneven cups."
"100% Pure Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee"|"Dauphin Kaffee"|"89"|"Miami"|"Florida"|"Blue Mountain growing region, eastern Jamaica"|"Jamaica"|"Caribbean"|"Medium-Dark"|"Aromatically a rather simple coffee, but an attractive one. Deep aroma dominated by a cherryish milk chocolate with hints of cedar and banana. Sweet-toned, roundly balanced cup with quiet acidity, fullish body and continued cherry-toned chocolate carrying into a plain but long finish."
"La Minita Costa Rica"|"Terroir Coffee"|"94"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica"|"Costa_Rica"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Delicately but richly nuanced throughout the profile with cherryish fruit, flowers, honey, milk chocolate. In the cup the acidity is tart but luxuriously sweet and the mouthfeel lightly syrupy. Flavor saturated and flawless finish."
"Orange Bourbon El Salvador"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"93"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Pure, finely articulated coffee with notes of coffee fruit (tart cherry), orange and a crisp, minty, distinct but uncandylike chocolate. The chocolate note carries into a finish that remains on the delicately rich side of astringent."
"Rwanda Bufcafe"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"92"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"Rwanda"|"Rwanda"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"A deep, roundly low-toned coffee with pleasingly deep, round, low-toned aroma with distinct lemony (perhaps orangy) chocolate notes. In the cup smooth, balanced acidity, silky mouthfeel, and tart cherry and continued lemon-toned chocolate notes. A note that could be called banana appears toward the long, flavor-saturated, very slightly astringent finish."
"El Salvador La Montana, Cup of Excellence #1"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"90"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"Chalatenango Department, El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Sweet- and low-toned aroma with orangy fruit and cedar and nut notes. In the cup very well-structured with a rich slightly wine-toned acidity and silky mouthfeel but rather simple aromatically: a genial but limited orange- and cherry-toned fruit. A floral hint surfaced in the otherwise simple finish."
"Panama Elida Estate, Best of Panama #3"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"89"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"Boquete growing region, western Panama"|"Panama"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Dark"|"Impressively intense, sweetly pungent aroma: flowers, chocolate, hints of butter and fresh-cut cedar. Rich, round, smooth-bodied and syrupy in the cup, with pleasing but limited aromatics: dusk flowers and hints of chocolate and dry berry that fade in the rich but simple finish."
"Kopi Luwak Robusta Dark Roast"|"Animalcoffee"|"84"|"Keperra"|"Queensland"|"Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"NA"|"Evaluated as espresso. As a drip coffee fell quite short of 80. As espresso revealed some virtues. In the aroma sweet-toned with distinct chocolate and butter notes. In the small cup medium bodied, round-toned and sweet, with earth, aromatic wood and herbal notes (I read fennel) and hints of nut and chocolate. The finish was simple in the short and mildly astringent in the long. Surprisingly disappointing in milk: leanish in mouthfeel with banana and chocolate in front but a slight though disturbing note toward the finish that for me suggested salted meat."

"Puro de Puerto Rico, Light Roast"|"Cafe Bello"|"90"|"Adjuntas"|"Puerto Rico"|"Adjuntas region, west-cental Puerto Rico"|"Puerto_Rico"|"Caribbean"|"Medium-Light"|"Sweet-toned, delicate aroma: distinct flowers (lilac?) orange, hints of honey and muted cedar. In the cup soft, sweet acidity, flowering grass, cocoa, orange. A slight grassy astringency in the finish suggests that at the time we cupped this coffee it was a bit too young. It may improve in the months following this review."

In the cup the mouthfeel is silky, almost syrupy, the acidity intense but delicate with shimmers of white wine. Orange, lemon, cocoaish chocolate, floral notes. Long, deep, flavor-saturated finish."
"Kenya AA Mathareini"|"Willoughby's Coffee & Tea"|"94"|"Branford"|"Connecticut"|"South-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Intense, exuberantly complex aroma: orange, grapefruit, honey, cedar, blackcurrant. In the cup the acidity is intense and sweet, the mouthfeel syrupy, the flavor continuingly complex, dry yet lush: blackcurrant, grapefruit, wine, a hint of milk chocolate. The finish is superb: saturated with grapefruit and chocolate, sweet, rich, long."
"El Salvador Cerreo Las Ranas"|"Coffee Bean Direct"|"90"|"Titusville"|"New Jersey"|"Western El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"A very light-roasted, naturally sweet coffee that stays just on the rich side of raw. Low-toned but intense aroma: nut notes (raw cashew?) with hints of flowers and butter. In the cup soft acidity with a shimmer of wine, substantial body, continued sweet raw nut notes with hints of butter, chocolate and flowers. Rich, long, slightly heavy finish."
"Yemen Mocha"|"Batdorf & Bronson Coffee Roasters"|"87"|"Olympia"|"Washington"|"Central north Yemen, probably near Sana'a"|"Yemen"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"Ambiguous flavors associated with fruity mustiness run through the profile. Co-cupper Miguel Meza (87) describes them as: “Sweet-smoky and medicinal. A pungent and musty full-bodied coffee with exotic hints of eucalyptus, sassafras and bakers’ yeast.”  Ken (86) is more conventional and more positive: “Rich, raisiny dark chocolate with a pungent cedar and herbal edge in aroma and rather syrupy cup.”"
"Organic Ethiopian Special Prep"|"Kickapoo Coffee"|"89"|"Viroqua"|"Wisconsin"|"Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Light"|"Both co-cupper Miguel Meza (88) and Ken (89) agreed that this coffee was low-toned, but for Ken it displayed a quietly resonant depth whereas apparently for Miguel it was simply quiet. Miguel found chocolate and citrus in the aroma, Ken chocolate and a distinct ginger note. Miguel read “blueberry, over-ripe fruit and toast” in the crisply fruity cup, Ken dry chocolate, brandy, blueberries, apricot, flowers. Both noted a persistence of berryish fruit in an otherwise rather thinnish finish."
"Los Lajones Natural Panama"|"Flying Goat Coffee"|"89"|"Healdsberg"|"California"|"Boquete growing region, western Panama"|"Panama"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Co-cupper Miguel Meza’s (88) description is succinct: “Cherry liqueur, smoke and chocolate.” Ken (90) finds a similar palette: dark raisin-toned chocolate, red wine, cherry, flowers. Ken interprets Miguel’s smoke notes as a slight hint of complicating mustiness. Altogether a quiet, wood-panels and leather easy chair sort of coffee."
"Ethiopia Aricha Seven"|"Zoka Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Co-cupper Miguel Meza (89) was rather faint in his praise of this coffee, finding a “floral and tropical citrus” character he associates with the more familiar washed or wet-processed Ethiopia profile, with added “chocolate and berry” nuance derived from dry-processing. Ken (91) wrestles with the detail a bit more, admiring a wine or brandy nuance to the chocolate and berry character, which he finds “lush but crisp.”"
"Ethiopian Yirgacheffe Hama"|"JBC Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Madison"|"Wisconsin"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Co-cupper Miguel Meza and Ken took different descriptive paths in an attempt to characterize the underlying structure of this low-toned, full-bodied coffee. For Miguel (92) the cup was “soft and comforting” with a mix of “dried fruit and mesquite” and “berries and chocolate.” Ken (89) felt the cup’s sweet yet salty structure dominated the berry- and cocoa-toned aromatics, making the cup attractive but limited."
"Ethiopian Worka"|"Klatch Coffee"|"91"|"San Dimas"|"California"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Co-cupper Miguel Meza (91) calls this coffee “juicy and refreshing,” Ken (91) “sweet and deep.” Both were impressed by a crisp, complex aroma (for Miguel “lemon-lime, cantaloupe and peach”) and as the cup cooled distinct cocoa and sweet ferment notes that Ken read as “brandied cherry” and Miguel (with more ambition to precision) as “distilled agave.”"
"Biloya Selection One Ethiopia"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"91"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"A soft cup, rather simple aromatically but “well-balanced” (co-cupper Miguel Meza, 91) and “smooth and deep in structure” (Ken, 91). Miguel finds “berries, citrus and chocolate,” Ken reads some quiet chocolate and perhaps some orange. The finish is quiet but impressive with continued chocolate and fruit (Miguel: strawberry and cherry) notes. (Previously reviewed and rated 92 ponts in June 2007)."
"Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Aricha Selection #7"|"JBC Coffee Roasters"|"92"|"Madison"|"Wisconsin"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Intense, complex aroma. Quite tropical for co-cupper Miguel Meza (92) who cites guava, pineapple, and orange; Ken’s (92) associations are more temperate: blueberry, cherry, orange, honey. In the cup both Ken and Miguel find cherry and chocolate, and most likely Miguel’s “mango and caramel” and Ken’s “candyish butterscotch” both are efforts to find descriptors for the same sensation, a pleasingly pungent sweetness. Miguel passes on the finish; Ken finds the usual flaw haunting this style of coffee: a slight salty astringency hiding amid the lovely fading trajectory of fruit."
"Ethiopia Beloya Selection One"|"Novo Coffee"|"93"|"Denver"|"Colorado"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Light"|"Miguel Meza (94) found only purity and ripeness in this opulent coffee; Ken (92) was impressed as well but felt just slightly let down by a limiting simplicity once past the aroma. Miguel Meza: “Vibrant, pure and ripe … Creamy mouthfeel with vanilla-like floral notes. Full and balanced with a juicy acidity that hints of peach, orange and berries in the long, clean finish.” Ken (92) admired the ripe, lush aroma every bit as much as Miguel for its “true dark chocolate, mint, floral and berry” notes, but observed that once past the aroma the cup simplified despite remaining “rich and berry-toned.” Miguel and Ken diverged most strongly over the finish, where Ken detected a shadow astringency amid the memories of aromatic complexity where Miguel found only clean flavor."
"Ethiopian Aricha Seven"|"Klatch Coffee"|"93"|"San Dimas"|"California"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Miguel Meza (93): “An intense but slightly flawed cup. The coffee is so luscious and passionate[, however,] that such misgivings are easily forgotten. A dizzying array of ripe and dried berry flavors mingles with banana, lime and chocolate.” Ken (93) agrees, finding a rich mix of “brandyish cherry, crisp cocoa/chocolate and ripe orange” notes. He is more specific about the flaw, which for him is a slight salty astringency that “softens as the cup cools, allowing the ripe fruit notes to fully bloom.”"
"Arena Selection One Yirgacheffe Ethiopia"|"Novo Coffee"|"93"|"Denver"|"Colorado"|"Southwestern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Light"|"Co-cupper Miguel Meza (94): “Intensely fragrant: strawberry, kiwi, cherry, amaretto. The cup is powerful, well-structured and dynamic, [progressively revealing] a whole universe of fruit flavor. Only a lingering sharp astringency, perhaps a side effect of he same process that developed the incredible range of flavors …, limits this coffee from near perfection.” Ken (92) found the lavish aroma and rich acidity particularly impressive, but like Miguel he found a slight nagging astringency in the finish, a shadow to this coffee’s monumental yet seductive aromatics."
"Ethiopian Aricha Selection 7"|"Barrington Coffee Roasting Co."|"93"|"Lee"|"Massachusetts"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Co-cupper Miguel Meza (92) finds bergamot and flowers in the aroma, Ken (94) finds flowers as well as cherries, red wine, and hints of chocolate and butter. In a cup that is “sweet” for Miguel, “rich and opulent” for Ken, both read cherries and blueberry and a positive fruit ferment note which Miguel nicely describes as ‘Grand Marnier” and Ken more prosaically as red wine. In either case a slight, pleasing (more so to Ken?) hint of ferment complicates a round, deep, lavishly fruity cup."
"Honduras El Filo Cup of Excellence"|"JBC Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Madison"|"Wisconsin"|"Honduras"|"Honduras"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Straightforward, lucid, classic. Very sweet-toned aroma with fresh coffee fruit (tart cherry) and honey notes, hints of cedar and lemon. In the cup the honeyish sweetness envelops an intense though not sharp acidity. Continued coffee fruit notes with a lemony lean. Richly tart finish."
"Sumatra Mandheling Decaf"|"Terroir Coffee"|"90"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Lintong growing district of the Lake Toba region, North Sumatra Province, Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"In the aroma deep-toned with moist earth and fruit tones that suggest molassy fruitcake or banana bread or a fruity dark chocolate. The candied fruit, molasses and moist earth complex carries into the cup, riding richly over a slight flatness introduced by decaffeination. Sweet, long, rich finish, very slightly astringent when hot but impressively smooth as the cup cools."

"Kenyan Highland Cooperatives"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"96"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"South-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"The aroma is very deep and sweet-toned with lush references to banana, coconut, dusk flowers. In the cup the acidity is extraordinarily rich and round-toned, the mouthfeel supple, the nuance opulent with coconut, red wine, chocolate and floral notes. Rich, long, flavor-saturated finish."
"Sumatra Lake Tawar"|"Paradise Roasters"|"95"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"Lake Tawar basin, Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Intense, sweetly tart aroma: flowers, cherry, lemon. In the cup the acidity is lyrically sweet, the mouthfeel silky, the flavor vivid with grapefruit, dry berry and floral notes that soften toward a raisiny chocolate as the cup cools. Superb finish: cleanly bright, long, sweet to the far end of sensation."
"Kenya Nyeri AA Tambaya Auction Lot"|"Paradise Roasters"|"92"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"South-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Deep, pungent aroma: cedar, orange, molasses, honey. In the cup sweetly and crisply acidy, with dry berry, continued citrus and honey notes and an underlying pungent richness that suggests moist pipe tobacco. Flavor-saturated short finish; a slight astringency in the long softens as the cup cools."
"Sumatran Lake Tawar"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"89"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Lake Tawar basin, Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Dark"|"Deep, roast-influenced aroma: gently scorched cedar, cardamom, orange.

In the full-bodied cup the dark, raisin-toned chocolate and the floral notes sustain, while the pungent tendencies in the aroma intensify, contributing a cedary, herby, rather salty character to the profile.

Lushly intense blueberry, chocolate, and floral-toned honey in the aroma.

"Yauco Selecto Puerto Rico"|"SpecialtyJava.com"|"85"|"Waconia"|"Minnesota"|"Yauco growing region, central Puerto Rico"|"Puerto_Rico"|"Caribbean"|"Light"|"Opens well: Very sweet-toned, deep aroma with a hint of mustiness that merely complicates a tight-knit, delicate complexity: cedar, semi-sweet chocolate, dry berry, orange.

Whatever we call it, it is a precious and agreeable sensation. The body is medium and the mouthfeel silky at a 6-ounce serving, slightly thinnish and lean at 8. Rich finish with good flavor persistence and excellent stability as the cup cools."
"Kona 10% Blend Extra Bold (K-Cup)"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"87"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Kona growing district, ""Big Island"" of Hawaii; other undisclosed growing regions"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium"|"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a “K-Cup” capsule to produce 6-ounce and 8-ounce serving sizes): The aroma displays a simple, pure coffee character: tartly sweet, chocolate-toned fruit and a hint of flowers. In the cup medium but silky bodied at 6 ounces, slightly thinnish at 8. At both serving sizes quite sweet, gently tart, with continued delicate chocolate-toned fruit notes. Nice persistence of chocolate and flowers in the finish, although this delicate, lyric coffee stiffens and simplifies a bit as the cup cools."
"PBS Blend (K-Cup)"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"85"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Chiapas State, southeastern Mexico"|"Mexico"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Dark"|"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a “K-Cup” capsule at a serving size of 6 ounces): Rather subdued aroma, caramelly, with hints of flowers and chocolate. In the cup medium-bodied but silky in mouthfeel, simple and bittersweet, with distant hints of flowers, walnut, chocolate perhaps. Simple, rich, rather short finish."
"Costa Rican Tarrazu"|"Gourmet Coffee Shop"|"88"|"Lenoir City"|"Tennessee"|"Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica"|"Costa_Rica"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"NA"|"In the aroma roundly and sweetly acidy with floral-toned coffee fruit and a hint of chocolate. In the cup gently acidy, medium-bodied with a smooth, almost syrupy mouthfeel. The aromatics remain simple, dominated by a floral-toned coffee fruit (think tart pie cherries)."
"Indonesia Celebes Kalossi"|"Coffeemaria"|"86"|"Addison"|"Illinois"|"Toraja (formerly Kalossi) growing region, southwestern Celebes (now Sulawesi), Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Dark"|"An extreme version of the traditional musty/earthy coffees of Indonesia, with the musty notes so intense that they seem to push the profile into a realm completely outside ordinary expectations associated with coffee. The earthy mildew character is sharply pungent but sweet throughout, with associations with other pungently sweet sensations, like grapefruit and the fresh smell of tomato vine."
"Java Blawan Estate"|"Alaska Coffee Roasting"|"88"|"Fairbanks"|"Alaska"|"East Java, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"Sweet-toned, mildly pungent aroma: cedar, molasses, a hint of milk chocolate. Very sweet in the cup and very delicate, with wispy walnut and continued milk chocolate notes. Surprisingly robust persistence of sweetness and flavor in the short finish; some astringency in the long."
"Sulawesi Toraja"|"The Roasterie"|"88"|"Kansas City"|"Missouri"|"Toraja (formerly Kalossi) growing region, southwestern Celebes (now Sulawesi), Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"Deep, rich, opulently sweet-toned aroma: cedar, hints of honey and orange. Heavy body and robustly rough mouthfeel in the cup, with a pungently earthy character that reads persuasively as a sort of dry but raisin-toned chocolate. The rich depth extends to the short finish, though astringency nags in the long."
"Java Blawan Estate"|"Coffee Bean Direct"|"88"|"Titusville"|"New Jersey"|"East Java, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"A quiet coffee. A subtle aromatic complex runs pleasantly through the profile from aroma through cup, so subtle it’s hard to pin down with specific associations: milk chocolate and banana I wrote for the aroma; switched to butterscotch for the cup, with a stiffening hint of walnut. The acidity is gently lively; the finish surprisingly rich given the quietness of the cup."
"Java Blawan Estate"|"Caffe Pronto Coffee Roastery"|"88"|"Annapolis"|"Maryland"|"East Java, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"A delicate – perhaps overly so – coffee that nevertheless rewards attentiveness to its subtle, complex aromatics: floral tones and a pungent note suggesting the fresh odor of tomato vines, with background suggestions of cocoa and white wine. A heavy astringency lurks in the mouthfeel that unfortunately dominates in the long finish as the heady aromatics fade."
"Aged Celebes"|"Moore Coffee"|"88"|"Ventura"|"California"|"Toraja (formerly Kalossi) growing region, southwestern Celebes (now Sulawesi), Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"A wonderfully sweet coffee whose lush character is balanced (or opposed) by a sharply musty earthiness. Taken together these tendencies read as a pungent citrus, grapefruit perhaps. Full body, very syrupy mouthfeel. Rich and very sweet in the short finish; in the long the musty tones introduce a mild astringency."
"Java Estate Pancour"|"Coffeemaria"|"89"|"Addison"|"Illinois"|"East Java, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"More Sumatra than Java: pungent, sweet earth notes dominate with distinct chocolate and tomato leanings. The earthy chocolate notes carry into a sweet short finish, slightly astringent long."
"Estate Java"|"Batdorf & Bronson Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Olympia"|"Washington"|"East Java, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"A strikingly distinctive coffee that suffers a bit in the finish. Splendid aroma: sweetly and deeply pungent, with floral, chocolate and pipe tobacco notes. In the cup low-toned but vibrant acidity, crisply nut-like with distinct orange notes. The nut notes turn very slightly stiff and dusty in the finish."
"Timor Maubesse Fair-Trade"|"Atomic Cafe Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Beverly"|"Massachusetts"|"East Timor"|"Timor"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Almost sugary sweet throughout the profile. Flowers and cedar in the aroma; the floral notes give way to a more pungent, tomatoey fruit and hints of cocoa in the cup. The sweetness carries straight into a rich short finish, fading to a mild astringency in the long."
"Bali Paradise Valley"|"Morghan Rake Coffee"|"92"|"Greencastle"|"Pennsylvania"|"Central Bali, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Light"|"Extraordinarily sweet-toned, lyrically delicate coffee, softly acidy, with orange, molasses, flowering grass and white wine notes. Clean, sweet, rich finish. Only a slight stiffening in the finish as the coffee cools holds this coffee back from an even higher rating."
"East Timor Maubesse Fair-Trade Organic"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"92"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"East Timor"|"Timor"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Very sweet, almost sugary, with raisiny fruit notes and hints of orange and chocolate carrying with rich stateliness from aroma to cup. Syrupy body, deep, resonant finish."
"Sumatra Blue Batak"|"Paradise Roasters"|"93"|"Anoka"|"Minnesota"|"Northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"The aroma is shifting, complex: sweet, smoky candied fruit suggests lemon drop at one moment, butterscotch the next; hints of flowers, fresh-fallen wet leaves, even milk chocolate. The influence of the sweet musty/earthy notes on the tart fruit becomes more explicit in the rich, gently pungent cup, reading as a sort of earthy lemon and fresh leather. Medium-bodied, syrupy mouthfeel. Sweetly rich finish."
"Costa Rica Orginal"|"Volcanica Coffee"|"88"|"Coral Springs"|"Florida"|"Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica"|"Costa_Rica"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Dark"|"Sweet-toned, deeply pungent aroma with cedar and butter notes and a suggestion of bittersweet chocolate. In the cup rather lean-bodied, delicately and cleanly roasty, but with limited nuance: butter, hints of chocolate and flowers. The chocolate implicit throughout the profile emerges with surprising and pleasing clarity in the finish, outlasting even a slight astringency."
"100% Kona Extra Fancy"|"Hula Daddy"|"90"|"Holualoa"|"Hawaii"|"South Kona growing district, ""Big Island"" of Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium"|"A simple but sweet, deeply resonant coffee with a big, smooth body and chocolate-toned fruit notes that read as a round, banana-inclined milk chocolate in the aroma. In the cup the chocolate turns toward cocoa and the fruit toward a gently tart, cherryish coffee fruit. Rich, straightforward finish with a very slight hint of astringency."
"Aged Piko’s Peaberry"|"Doi Chaang Coffee"|"89"|"Calgary"|"Alberta"|"Northern Thailand"|"Thailand"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Dark"|"A quiet but interesting coffee: soft, low-toned, with hints of cedar, warm spice, chocolate, and a low-acid fruit that suggests banana. The chocolate notes become more explicit in the impressively long, resonant finish."
"Single Origin Dark Roast"|"Doi Chaang Coffee"|"85"|"Calgary"|"Alberta"|"Northern Thailand"|"Thailand"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"NA"|"Notes:"
"El Salvador Los Planes Cup of Excellence 2006"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"95"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Delicate, gently bright coffee with distinct, cedar-toned dry berry notes (the kind often called black currant) carrying from aroma to cup, support by cocoa, orange (perhaps better, tangerine) and floral nuance. The body is rather light, but the mouthfeel is gently lively, almost effervescent. Clean, rich finish with impressive flavor persistence, particularly of the orange/cocoa notes."
"Huila El Palacio Colombia"|"PT's Coffee Roasting Co."|"94"|"Topeka"|"Kansas"|"Huila Department, southern Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"A deeply floral-toned coffee. The floral tones are rich and rose-like in both aroma and cup, with caramelly, almost custard-like support and hints of cedar and cocoa. The finish is sweet, deep and long."
"Detroit St. Decaf"|"Zingerman's Coffee"|"91"|"Ann Arbor"|"Michigan"|"Guatemala"|"Guatemala"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Dark"|"A versatile espresso with a pungent authority that should serve particularly well in big milk drinks. Slightly spicy, apricot- or mango-toned fruit in the deeply sweet-impressioned aroma. In the small cup displays full, syrupy body and a rather opulently sweet, chocolate-toned richness with a balancing cedar pungency. Slight astringency in the long finish. In milk rounds and blossoms nicely but dominates with semi-sweet chocolate authority and a slight but discernible astringent edge in the finish."
"Decaf Espresso, Costa Rica La Lapa"|"Terroir Coffee"|"92"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Costa Rica"|"Costa_Rica"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Dark"|"Crisp, elegant espresso with dry berry and floral notes. Shows a hint of sweet, tomato-toned acidity in the aroma along with caramel and flowers. In the small cup surprisingly full-bodied with cedar, dry berry and a continuing shimmer of flowers. Clean, rich finish. Masters milk with a delicate, dry-chocolate-toned authority. The floral notes survive with startling clarity in milk, persisting far into the finish."
"Kenya AA Gitugu Muranaa"|"Paradise Roasters"|"93"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"South-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Quietly intense aroma, softly and sweetly high-toned, dry berry notes. In the cup medium-bodied with a silky mouthfeel, with the mild acidy edge and tart dry berry notes enveloped in sweetness, netting a floral, Riesling-like buoyancy."
"Colombia Timana"|"Caribou Coffee"|"88"|"Minneapolis"|"Minnesota"|"Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Round, rich aroma with distinct butter notes and hints of flowers and lemon. Simplifies in the cup: good body and a sweet, gently crisp structure, but little nuance."
"Organic Bolivian Coffee, Cumbre Supremo, New England Light Roast"|"Cafe Valverde"|"89"|"West Newberry"|"Massachusetts"|"Bolivia"|"Bolivia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Superb, richly sweet-toned aroma: semi-sweet chocolate with hints of raisins and cedar. In the cup rather lean-bodied, delicate, with crisp, very distinct cocoa-chocolate notes nuanced by hints of lemon, caramel, raisin."
"Organic, Fair-Trade Bolivia Caranavi"|"Counter Culture Coffee"|"89"|"Durham"|"North Carolina"|"Caranavi region, north of La Paz, Bolivia"|"Bolivia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Soft, sweet-toned aroma with limited but pleasing nuance: cedar, perhaps tomato. Remains sweet in the cup, crisply delicate, with very pronounced sweet cocoa tones. Superb finish: sweet, long and cocoa-laced."
"Colombia Huila Supremo"|"Zoka Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Huila Department, southern Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"NA"|"Crisply sweet-toned aroma with cedar and butter notes. In the cup silky mouthfeel and a quiet, tight-knit complexity: distinct cocoa and hints of cedar, orange, flowers, butter. Smooth, gently rich, very persistent and pleasing finish."
"Tres Santos Colombia"|"Intelligentsia Coffee"|"90"|"Chicago"|"Illinois"|"Valle de Cauca Department, western Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Sweet-toned aroma with delicate floral-, cherry- and chocolate-toned fruit notes. In the cup more striking for its superb body and balanced structure than for its agreeable but limited nuance, a dry cherry-chocolate. The long, deep finish stays just on the rich side of astringent."
"Peru Cochapampa Fair-Trade"|"Flying Goat Coffee"|"91"|"Healdsberg"|"California"|"Quillabamba region, south-central Peru"|"Peru"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Rather thin aroma, with semi-sweet chocolate hints. In the cup the chocolate turns explicit, crisp and pleasantly cocoaish. The finish is surprisingly rich, with continued cocoa tones and a hint of flowers. The cup generally relaxes and plumps up as it cools."
"Colombia Cup of Excellence Lot #8 Hato Viejo"|"Torreo Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Philadelphia"|"Pennsylvania"|"Narino Department, southern Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Light"|"Very sweet-toned aroma with orange and pipe-tobacco notes.

Cedar, orange, distinct butterscotch, tomato, perhaps chocolate in the aroma. In the cup low-toned acidity and lightly syrupy in mouthfeel, with an almost sugary sweetness and tight-knit notes of butterscotch, caramel, honey, ripe but slightly tart orange. Rich and sweet in the short finish, though a slight hint of astringency surfaces in the long."
"Colombia Hato Viejo Cup of Excellence"|"Atomic Cafe Coffee Roasters"|"94"|"Beverly"|"Massachusetts"|"Narino Department, southern Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"A classic cup: pure, simple, intense, refined. Sweet-toned but crisp aroma: tomato, cedar, cardamom, chocolate. Richly and sweetly acidy in the cup with the classic complex of flowers and fresh coffee fruit with rounding hints of chocolate."

In the aroma low-toned and round with hints of flowers and cherry-toned fruit. Softly acidy and sweetly and deeply rich in the cup. Sweet, almost sugary finish."
"Colombia Cauca, Special Micro-Lot Selection Juvenal Penna"|"La Golondrina by Counter Culture Coffee"|"94"|"Durham"|"North Carolina"|"Cauca Department, southern Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Sweet-toned, quietly complex aroma: cherryish, chocolate-toned fruit with a hint of herby cedar. In the cup softly acidy and richly and exquisitely balanced, with the fruit taking on a distinct black cherry character. A coffee whose excellence ultimately lies in its suave authority and completeness."

"Colombia Tolima Reynel Perez Micro-Lot"|"Paradise Roasters"|"96"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"Tolima growing region, south-central Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Exhilaratingly intense but roundly sweet-toned aroma: black cherry, flowers, milk chocolate, with an underlying cedar-toned crispness. Sweet flowers and cherry dominate in the cup with an almost symphonic richness of tone. Medium bodied but silky mouthfeel. The floral notes linger into the farthest reaches of the finish."
"PBS Blend, Organic Fair-Trade"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"87"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Chiapas State, southeastern Mexico"|"Mexico"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Rich, simple aroma: cedar and butter.

"Sumatra"|"Starbucks Coffee"|"84"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"NA"|"Notes:"
"Lively Colombian"|"Folgers Gourmet Selections"|"84"|"Cincinnati"|"Ohio"|"Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Sweet, round but crisp profile. Attractive nuance in the aroma – raisin, cedar, pipe tobacco, a hint of chocolate – fades quickly in the cup, leaving behind only the faintest shimmer of floral-toned chocolate. Sweet, distantly chocolate-toned finish, but quite astringent in the mouthfeel."
"Kona Coffee Blend Light Roast"|"Millstone Coffee"|"85"|"Cincinnati"|"Ohio"|"The Kona growing region of the Big Island of Hawaii and other undisclosed origins"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium-Dark"|"Subdued, sweet-toned aroma: cedar, hints of chocolate and prune-toned fruit. Round, simple, and rather richly bittersweet in the cup, with some hints of flowers, chocolate and prune. Deep, resonant short finish thins toward astringency in the long."
"African Kitamu"|"Starbucks Coffee"|"87"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"East Africa"|"East_Africa"|"Africa"|"Dark"|"A very interesting profile, shallow in depth of sensation but intensely complex within that narrow range. Crisply roasty but lively aroma with sweet apple and floral-toned chocolate notes. Continued roasty in the cup with distinct, sweetly lemony fruit and continued hints of flowers and chocolate."
"Brown Gold"|"Brown Gold"|"88"|"Fort Worth"|"Texas"|"Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"Intense aroma vivid with tart cherry notes and hints of chocolate and tomato.

"Organic Ethiopian Yirgacheffe"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"86"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Yirgacheffe growing district, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Pungently bittersweet, rather austere coffee. Deep aroma, with tomato and rosemary notes and perhaps some semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup, rich, simple, bittersweet with continued tomato, Mediterranean herb and semi-sweet chocolate notes."
"Kenyan AA"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"96"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"A coffee at once voluptuous and austere. Delicately complex aroma: flowers, chocolate, tobacco leaves, lemon grass. In the cup an amazingly rich, wine-like acidity, sweet flowers, and a gently crisp, dry berry fruit. Hints of chocolate re-emerge in the cleanly long, almost perfect finish."
"Panama La Esmeralda Geisha"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"92"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Boquete growing region, western Panama"|"Panama"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Very sweet-toned, exquisitely balanced aroma with floral, candied lemon and sweet herb notes. In the cup intense, tartly sweet acidity and buoyant mouthfeel with white wine and continued sweet lemon notes. The barest hint of chocolate in the cup blooms with soft explicitness in the surprisingly sweet finish. The cup stiffens ever so slightly as it cools."
"El Salvador Santa Sofia"|"Paradise Roasters"|"90"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Dark chocolate and caramel in the aroma. Luscious body, cherry-laced dark chocolate in the cup."
"El Salvador Montenegro"|"Zoka Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Cocoa and caramel aroma. Blazing acidity, dark chocolate and caramel, regal balance. A nicely conducted, relatively light roast makes this balanced but assertive coffee particularly well-suited for vacuum pot and drip brewing."
"Nicaragua Los Vasques"|"Stone Cup Roasting"|"91"|"Chattanooga"|"Tennessee"|"Madriz growing region, Nicaragua"|"Nicaragua"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Crisply acidy but big-bodied and lavishly chocolate-toned.

"Nicaragua Los Vasques"|"Stumptown Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Portland"|"Oregon"|"Madriz growing region, Nicaragua"|"Nicaragua"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Huge body, luscious Belgian chocolate flavor with plenty of supporting acidity.

Ideally roasted."
"Panama Esmeralda Especial"|"Stumptown Coffee Roasters"|"95"|"Portland"|"Oregon"|"Boquete growing region, western Panama"|"Panama"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Spectacularly aromatic in both dry and infused aroma: candied lemon peel, bergamot, hints of jasmine. Medium bodied and sweet, with superb acidity and flavors that suggest both the mentholated citrus of a Yirgacheffe and the blueberry notes of a Harrar, but without a trace of ferment or earthiness. Perfumed perfection."
"El Salvador Pacamara Los Planes"|"Intelligentsia Coffee"|"95"|"Chicago"|"Illinois"|"El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Cocoa laced with citrus in the aroma. Flavors are as complex and sculpted as a top Alsatian Riesling, with intense lemon and orange acidity, chocolate, and a suggestion of fresh chive or tarragon always associated with this variety.  A powerful, aristocratic grand cru. This fragile, low-density variety is a major challenge to roast (and cannot handle dark roasting); this is a particularly masterful roasting job."
"El Salvador Los Planes Pacamara"|"Torreo Coffee Roasters"|"96"|"Philadelphia"|"Pennsylvania"|"El Salvador"|"El_Salvador"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Chocolate and citrus on the break. Regal acidity, complex flavors of chocolate, citrus and herbs. A powerful, intense and demanding cup. Haunting, persistent finish. Perfect roast of this especially challenging bean.

Tudor Estate"|"88"|"Holualoa"|"Hawaii"|"North Kona growing district, Big Island of Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium-Dark"|"Sweetly pungent aroma with hints of chocolate, cedar, low-acid fruit, pear perhaps. In the cup medium-bodied but silky in mouthfeel, with great sweetness, a roast-muted tartness, elegant floral notes and coffee fruit turned toward cocoa under the influence of the roast. Rich, sweet and cocoa-toned in the short finish, rather astringent in the long."
"Sulawesi Toraja"|"California Coffee Roasters"|"89"|"Moorpark"|"California"|"Toraja growing region, southwestern Sulawesi, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"Intense, gently pungent aroma with great, low-toned complexity: vanilla, honey, caramel, banana, semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup a heavy bittersweetness and rough mouthfeel initially dominate, but as the cup begins to cool a honeyish sweetness and rich semi-sweet chocolate emerge and persist into the finish."
"Panama Lot 13 Special Reserve"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"89"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Boquete growing region, western Panama"|"Panama"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Delicate, lyrically sweet-toned aroma with flowers, flowering grass and a lush shimmer of molasses. In the cup delicate but intense, with sweetly tart, white-wine-toned acidity, light-bodied but silky mouthfeel, and continued fresh, aromatic grass notes. Surprisingly rich in the short finish with a shadow of grassy astringency in the long."
"Kenya Karindundu Nyeri"|"Terroir Coffee"|"90"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Nyeri growing region, south-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"An intense coffee dominated from aroma through finish by a rich, tartly sweet acidity and high-toned lemon and dry berry notes. The finish, like the entire profile, is as deeply sweet as it is uncompromisingly dry."
"Ethiopia Kaffa Forest"|"Paradise Roasters"|"92"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"Kefa (Kaffa) Province, southwestern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Very complete aroma: pungently acidy but sweet-toned, with fat banana-like fruit and chocolate hints. In the cup gently round, rich acidity, medium body, silky mouthfeel, and distinct orange, lavender and fresh pipe tobacco notes with a little chocolate lean toward the finish. Excellent flavor persistence in the long, complex finish."
"Kenya Mamuto Kirinyaga"|"Terroir Coffee"|"96"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Kirinyaga growing district, Central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Vividly lively yet elegantly smooth coffee. Intense aroma with tart cherry and round, low-acid fruit notes, banana perhaps, with hints of fresh leather. In the cup sweet, lyric acidity, light but silky mouthfeel, cherry and cocoa notes.

"Belo Espresso"|"Ferroni Brothers"|"86"|"Doral"|"Florida"|"Ribeirao do Pinhal region, State of Parana, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium-Light"|"Sweet-toned aroma but rather quiet: raisin, dark chocolate, walnut, floral complication.

"Ethiopian Hache"|"Klatch Coffee"|"89"|"San Dimas"|"California"|"Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Sweet, lyric fruit in the aroma: cherry, chocolate-toned blueberry. The fruit mutes in the small cup but the underlying structure is pleasing: rich, intense, medium-bodied and silky in mouthfeel. The berry notes carry into the slightly heavy finish. The blueberry character fattens nicely in milk, though the chocolate side of the flavor complex remains a bit tight and restrained."
"Yirgacheffe Single-Origin Espresso"|"Terroir Coffee"|"90"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"A delicate but intense lemony chocolate dominates from aroma through demitasse to milk. The lemon-toned chocolate is lavish and sweet in the aroma; in the small cup tartly sweet; in finish pleasantly persistent despite a slight astringency. In milk the lemon mutes while the chocolate rounds out lushly."
"Sumatran Reserve Fair Trade Organic (K-Cup)"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"87"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a “K-Cup” capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): Smoke and earth notes in the aroma are brightened by a hint of floral-toned vanilla.

"Guatemala Huehuetenango El Limonar Estate, Dark Roast"|"JBC Coffee Roasters"|"87"|"Madision"|"Wisconsin"|"Huehuetenango growing region, Guatemala"|"Guatemala"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Dark"|"Intense, deeply rich aroma dominated by cedar notes with hints of plum or prune that lean toward semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup smooth and substantial in mouthfeel, powerful and balanced, but limited in nuance. Like the cup, the finish is structurally impressive (rich, clean) but simple."

"Black Apron Exclusive Kopi Kampung Sulawesi"|"Starbucks Coffee"|"86"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Toraja growing region, southwestern Sulawesi, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Dark"|"Hints of banana-toned fruit, chocolate, fresh-baked bread in the complex but rather listless aroma. Thin though silky mouthfeel. Pungent, gently burned cedar character in the cup, with floral and caramelly chocolate suggestions. Nicely malty finish, but a hint of burned building rubber."
"Roastmaster’s Reserve Volcan Tacana"|"Caribou Coffee"|"88"|"Minneapolis"|"Minnesota"|"Chiapas State, Mexico"|"Mexico"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Orange, raisiny chocolate, and pungent herbal notes in the aroma. Delicate in the cup, with continued orange-chocolate and pungent herb notes. Slightly bitter in the short finish, but smoothes out and sweetens nicely in the long."
"Special Reserve Ethiopian Sidamo Natural Process"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"89"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"A sweet fruit ferment contributes to an intense aromatic complexity that carries from nose to cup: Spicy, rose-like flowers, honey, blueberry, ripe peach, a hint of chocolate. The finish is rich and blueberry-toned, but cup and finish both stiffen just a bit as the coffee cools, revealing a hint of heavy astringency."
"Private Reserve Nicaraguan Las Nubes, Cup of Excellence"|"Coffee Masters"|"89"|"Spring Grove"|"Illinois"|"Neuva Segovia growing region, Nicaragua"|"Nicaragua"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Nut, prune, cedar and citrus, perhaps grapefruit, in the rich, low-toned aroma. Very sweet in the cup, pungent, with continued walnut and citrus notes and suggestions of earth or moist leaves. Everything settles toward chocolate in the rich finish. The cup roughens very slightly as it cools."
"Costa Rica Brumas del Zurqui"|"The Roasterie"|"90"|"Kansas City"|"Missouri"|"Central Costa Rica"|"Costa_Rica"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Intense aroma: tart cherry, caramel, hints of lemon, flowers, chocolate. In the cup delicate and pure: brings the fresh, dusky floral and tart cherry notes of coffee flowers and fruit into the cup with continuing hints of chocolate and lemon. The finish is clean, simple, ingenuous."
"Colombia El Lechal Cup of Excellence"|"Terroir Coffee"|"91"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Cauca growing region, southern Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Light"|"A whisper of an aroma, but a complex one: flowering grass, caramel, honey, a hint of chocolate. Amazingly sweet and delicately lush in the cup, with the honey notes intensifying and the floral notes declaring as spicy tea rose. The honey and floral notes persist in the surprisingly long, resonant finish."
"Panama Esmerald Especial"|"Stumptown Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Portland"|"Oregon"|"Boquete growing region, western Panama"|"Panama"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Cherry notes dominate in the very sweet-toned, pungently acidy aroma. Relatively light-bodied in the cup, but sweetly and buoyantly acidy, with striking and complex aromatic notes: cherry, tea rose, Meyer Lemon, orange, honey. Honey in particular persists in the rich, sweet, though slightly astringent finish."
"Colombian Dos Quebradas Special Reserve Cup of Excellence"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Huila Department, southern Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"A deep, spicy floral character – dusk flowers, tea rose – leads in aroma and cup, supported by low-acid fruit notes – peach, cherry – and hints of milk chocolate and leather. The acidity is deep-toned and round, the finish rich and clean."
"Kenya Kithua Estates"|"Barefoot Coffee Roasters"|"91"|"Santa Clara"|"California"|"South-Central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"Pungent but sweet throughout the profile. In the aroma caramel, fruit-toned, slightly smoky cedar, orange. In the cup the pungent, smoky fruit notes read as a tartly sweet grapefruit, perhaps dry berry, with continuing undercurrents of caramel sweetness. Distinct orange notes resurface in the rich finish."
"Ethiopia Chichu"|"Novo Coffee"|"91"|"Denver"|"Colorado"|"Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Powerful, sweet-toned aroma: cherry, honey, tea-rose, milk chocolate, with a very mild ferment that reads as delicate Riesling-like wine. In the cup the honey and rose-like floral notes persist lushly, with the fruit notes turning from dark cherry to a tarter coffee fruit. The felicitous ferment deepens, reading more as brandy than wine. The finish is rich and deep, with an attractive persistence of flower, cherry and honey, but is weighed by the astringent heaviness usual with even the best of this style of dry-processed coffee."
"Kenya Karindundu"|"Terroir Coffee"|"93"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Nyeri growing region, south-central Kenya"|"Kenya"|"Africa"|"Medium-Light"|"Intense, lyrically sweet coffee: honey, flowers and the pure notes of coffee fruit carry from aroma to cup; the acidity is tart but caramelly, even buttery. Impeccably clean, delicately rich finish."
"Sumatra Lake Tawar"|"Batdorf & Bronson Coffee Roasters"|"94"|"Olympia"|"Washington"|"Lake Tawar basin, Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"In the aroma intense, pungent with grapefruit and cedar notes. In the cup full-bodied, with the dominating earthy pungency enveloped in deep sweetness. Continued grapefruit, pineapple and cedar notes settle toward honey and chocolate. Sweet, resonant, rich finish, totally free of astringency."
"Sumatra Lake Tawar"|"Paradise Roasters"|"94"|"Ramsey"|"Minnesota"|"Lake Tawar basin, Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"Tartly sweet fruit notes suggest pineapple, grapefruit or perhaps black currant in the aroma, with delicate undercurrents of caramel and earth. In the cup the musty/malty earth notes move richly forward, backgrounding the continuing crisp, pineapply fruit. A slight astringency in the short finish gives way to sweetness and pineapple in the long."
"Mahled Gahfae Thai Arabica, City Roast"|"Koolbreeze Distribution"|"87"|"South Lake Tahoe"|"California"|"Thailand"|"Thailand"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"In the aroma richly pungent with low-toned, rather subdued nuance: hints of banana, cedar, date perhaps. In the cup quiet, balanced, bittersweet, with faint whispers of nutmeg, raw date, butter, aromatic wood, all persisting into the rich finish."
"Pitalito Swiss Water Decaf"|"The Roasterie"|"88"|"Kansas City"|"Missouri"|"San Agustin growing region, Huila Department, southern Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Roses, milk chocolate and a hint of aromatic wood in the aroma. Crisp and richly delicate in the cup, with continued hints of aromatic wood, spicy rose and a sweet chocolate. The finish is simple but clean and rich."
"Fair-Trade Breakfast Blend"|"The Organic Coffee Company"|"85"|"San Leandro"|"California"|"Central and South America"|"South_America"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"Both co-cupper Danny O’Neill (83) and Ken (87) admired an aroma that was “sweet and spicy” for Danny, “rich, deep and sweetly smoky” for Ken. For Danny the cup was “muddled” and woody, for Ken slightly astringent in structure but nevertheless pleasantly bittersweet with a rich cocoa character that strengthened as the coffee cooled."
"African Summer Blend"|"Caffe Pronto Coffee Roastery"|"86"|"Annapolis"|"Maryland"|"East Africa"|"East_Africa"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"An exciting coffee that disappoints in the finish. Ken (88) was more forgiving than co-cupper Danny O’Neill (83), who sums up: “Bright and clean in the nose, this coffee’s lusciously thick and smooth body rounds its slightly fruity, almost wine-like, acidity. Sweet honey and fruit flavors become sharp and  … astringent in the long finish.”  Perhaps the dry-processed Ethiopias in this blend are last year’s crop, with their explosive aromatics too faded to compensate for an underlying mildly astringent structure."

"Black Apron Exclusive Kopi Kampung Sulawesi"|"Starbucks Coffee"|"86"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Toraja growing region, southwestern Sulawesi, Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"NA"|"Very sweet-toned, quietly complex aroma: smoke, semi-sweet chocolate and tart berryish fruit notes. Little of the aromatic complexity survives in the lean-bodied cup, only wisps of nut and crisp, smoky chocolate that fade quickly in the finish, leaving behind faint sweetness and a muted astringency."
"SLO Roasted Coffee Morning Fog Lifter"|"Central Coast Coffee Roasting"|"87"|"Los Osos"|"California"|"Indonesia"|"Indonesia"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"NA"|"Notes:"
"Monte Crisol Costa Rican Tarrazu"|"Old Bisbee Roasters"|"88"|"Bisbee"|"Arizona"|"Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica"|"Costa_Rica"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Dark"|"In the aroma cedar plus flowers and roast-influenced caramel and banana notes. A roast-muted acidity gently lifts the cup, where the cedar and caramel notes persist while the banana-toned fruit notes drift toward chocolate. Quiet short finish with a slight astringency in the long. Reader Ed Escobar says he has been “impressed by the consistent quality and freshness” of the coffees he has been buying from Old Bisbee Roasters."
"Organic Guatemala"|"Caffe Vita"|"88"|"Seattle"|"Washington"|"Guatemala"|"Guatemala"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Dark"|"A cup either pleasingly delicate or disappointingly simple depending on taste and expectation. Balanced, gentle aroma with a very fresh, foresty cedar and a suggestion of pear-toned fruit. In the cup the cedar and fruit tones finally settle into a sweet, raisin-toned chocolate. Reader Laura Cheng nominated another Central American coffee from Caffe Vita that was not available, so we took the liberty of ordering this one instead."
"Colombia Los Lirios Cup of Excellence"|"Batdorf & Bronson Coffee Roasters"|"88"|"Olympia"|"Washington"|"Tolima Department, Colombia"|"Colombia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Fine aroma: high-toned, elegant, combining suggestions of flowers, lemon, cedar and peach in a single suave, tight-knit aromatic gesture. In the cup delicately rich, light-bodied but not lean, gently acidy. The peach-floral-lemon gesture deepens and leans toward chocolate. Only the finish is disappointing: short and slightly but distractingly astringent."
"Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Bella Kara"|"Klatch Coffee"|"89"|"San Dimas"|"California"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"The aroma is intense and complex: cherry, blueberry, brandy, chocolate, with an underlying edge of pungently spicy cedar. All carry richly into the cup with an excitement a bit too edgy for elegance. A slight shadow of astringency lurking in the cup emerges clearly in the long finish."
"Organic Fair-Trade Ethiopia Sidamo Shanta Golba"|"Counter Culture Coffee"|"90"|"Durham"|"North Carolina"|"Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"Opulently complex aroma: cherry, blueberry, dry semi-sweet chocolate, brandy. In the cup very sweet, gently rich; the chocolate grows rounder and more distinct with continued blueberry and brandy complication. The rich, dry brandy notes dominate a slight astringency in the finish."
"Guatemala Antigua"|"Reading Coffee Roasters"|"90"|"Birdsboro"|"Pennsylvania"|"Antigua valley, central Guatemala"|"Guatemala"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium"|"Simple but classically appealing coffee. High-toned, sweetly spicy aroma with tight-knit suggestions of flowers, chocolate and sweet tomato that amplify in the richly acidy cup. The finish stays on the roundly hearty side of astringent."
"Bolivia Carrasco Pica del Tucan"|"Counter Culture Coffee"|"93"|"Durham"|"North Carolina"|"Carrasco growing region, Bolivia"|"Bolivia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"The attraction of this coffee is a structure both powerful and elegant: richly and roundly acidy, with silky-verging-on-syrupy mouthfeel, fundamental sweetness, and ringing depth of sensation. The wispy hints of chocolate, cherry and cedar are a bonus. Reader Mike Venditto’s nomination of a Counter Culture coffee was not available, so we substituted this rather similar Bolivia."
"Marques de Paiva Gourmet Organic Decaf"|"Bom Dia Cafe"|"86"|"Miami"|"Florida"|"South-Central Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Sweet-toned, intense aroma with walnut and chocolate notes and a hint of peach-like fruit. In the cup gentle, delicate, sweet, with a pleasantly vegetal cocoa character, a continued hint of fruit, and walnut tones that turn just a bit flat and woody as the cup cools. Delicate, pleasing but simple finish with continued walnut notes."
"Marques de Paiva Gourmet Organic Dark Roast"|"Bom Dia Cafe"|"87"|"Miami"|"Florida"|"Sul de Minas growing region, southern Minas Gerais State, Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Dark"|"Notes:"
"Marques de Paiva Gourmet Organic Medium Roast"|"Bom Dia Cafe"|"88"|"Miami"|"Florida"|"South-Central Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Deep, pungently sweet aroma with cocoa, caramelly cedar, raisin, date and honey notes. In the cup rich, low-key, gently bittersweet with continued, very distinct cocoa and honey/date notes. Long finish with excellent flavor persistence. The cup flattens slightly as it cools."
"Marques de Paiva Gourmet Rainforest Alliance Breakfast Blend"|"Bom Dia Cafe"|"88"|"Miami"|"Florida"|"South-Central Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium-Dark"|"A gently sweet, ingratiating coffee. In the aroma caramel, cedar and orange notes with a hint of flowers. In the cup very sweet, with a dominating fruit-toned cocoa that carries into the long, clean finish."
"Marques de Paiva Gourmet Fair Trade French Roast"|"Bom Dia Cafe"|"88"|"Miami"|"Florida"|"South-Central Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"NA"|"Notes:"
"Brazil Fazenda Cachoeria Reserve Espresso"|"Ecco Caffe"|"90"|"Santa Rosa"|"California"|"Mogiana growing region, Sao Paulo State, south-central Brazil"|"Brazil"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Very deep, richly fruity aroma: banana, raisin perhaps, hints of chocolate and rose-like flowers. In the small cup the body is full and syrupy, the flavor simple, deep-toned, with cedar and tart fruit notes – tamarind perhaps – the finish rich and long. Masters milk with an understated balance and a soft persistence of banana, cedar and chocolate notes."
"Tawar Rouge"|"Novo Coffee"|"91"|"Denver"|"Colorado"|"Sumatra, Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium"|"Superb fruity, caramelly aroma with distinct brandy and chocolate notes. In the small cup medium body, dominated by caramel and cedar notes with only a hint of cherryish brandy intrigue. The fruity brandy tones intensify in the finish, though with a very slight bitterish edge. They reach their apotheosis in milk, however, where they finally free themselves from their slight bitter shadow and bloom with lush, powerful expressiveness."
"S.O. Ethiopia Yirgacheffe"|"Paradise Roasters"|"92"|"Anoka"|"Minnesota"|"Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia"|"Ethiopia"|"Africa"|"Medium-Dark"|"Delicately soft aroma: dusk-blooming flowers, lemon, a hint of milk chocolate and caramel. In the small cup medium to light in body but smooth in mouthfeel, with continued lemon and floral top notes working above gently pungent cedar and semi-sweet chocolate mid-tones. Sweet, long, roundly lemony finish. In milk just on the edge of thin-bodied, but the lemony chocolate flavor notes are distinctive and superb."
"Nicaragua Madriz Cup of Excellence Single Origin Espresso"|"Terroir Coffee"|"92"|"Acton"|"Massachusetts"|"Madriz, Nicaragua"|"Nicaragua"|"CentralAmerica_Mexico"|"Medium-Light"|"Delicate but deep aroma: flowers, orange, peach, with a suggestion of chocolate. In the small cup smooth, substantial mouthfeel, sweetly crisp in flavor with hints of cedar, lemon, and dry-toned peach. Resonant, impeccably clean finish. Chocolate and fresh leather in milk, with continued complicating hints of peach and orange."
"S.O. India Sitara"|"Paradise Roasters"|"94"|"Anoka"|"Minnesota"|"Southern India"|"India"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Deep, very sweet-toned aroma, with chocolate, flowers, walnut, and a hint of carnal fruit – peach or papaya. In the small cup very full body, but not heavy – the mouthfeel is lively, almost effervescent. In flavor very sweet, very deep, with cedar and a gently spicy semi-sweet chocolate. Superb finish: long, caramelly, rich. Exerts a simple but powerful presence in milk: sweet milk chocolate with perhaps a shimmer of flowers."
"100% Kona Medium Roast"|"Trader Joe's"|"84"|"Pasadena"|"California"|"Kona growing district, ""Big Island"" of Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium"|"Pungent, spicy or perhaps smoky aroma, with caramel notes and a hint of apple. In the cup rather sharply acidy with very distinct caramel notes and not much else. A bright, simple, limited coffee."
"Kona Fancy"|"Surf City Coffee"|"85"|"Aptos"|"California"|"Kona growing district, ""Big Island"" of Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium"|"A contradictory coffee, with sweetly buoyant flowering grass and vanilla notes shimmering above a pungent heaviness in both aroma and cup. The pungent notes hint at semi-sweet chocolate in the aroma but turn rather bitter in the cup, compromising the continuing agreeable floral character."
"Maui Mokka"|"Supreme Bean Coffee Roasters"|"85"|"North Hollywood"|"California"|"Kaanapali district, near Lahaina, West Maui, Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium-Light"|"Fermented fruit contributes to a glorious aroma dominated by a sort of dry, nutty chocolate. In the cup very sweet and floral but also quite astringent, netting a wildly ambiguous profile with intriguing fruit notes too astringent to call chocolate and too explosively fermented to call winy. Unorthodox palates might assign high ratings to this unusual coffee, while purists surely would choke and dismiss it. We compromised at 85 – buyers beware."
"100% Kona Peaberry Dark Roast"|"Bay View Farm"|"85"|"Honaunau"|"Hawaii"|"South Kona growing district, ""Big Island"" of Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium-Dark"|"Sweetly roasty throughout the profile: fresh-cut cedar and hints of cardamom and flowers in the aroma; in the cup silky in mouthfeel, very sweet, with continuing cedar and intensified floral notes. Slightly astringent, almost turpenny in the long finish."
"Twigg-Smith Estate Ohana Medium Roast"|"Kona Blue Sky Coffee"|"87"|"Holualoa"|"Hawaii"|"Kona growing district, ""Big Island"" of Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium-Light"|"Fine aroma: delicate but deep, with milk chocolate, floral and caramelly fruit notes, apple perhaps. In the cup softly acidy, velvety in mouthfeel; the chocolate turns toward sweet cocoa with a richly tart floral twist. Surprisingly long finish, but also surprisingly heavy and even astringent. Cups were slightly uneven with occasional very faint musty fermented suggestions as they cooled, so a rating that started at 90 ended at an ambivalent 87."
"Kona Fancy"|"Don Francisco's Coffee"|"87"|"Vernon"|"California"|"Kona growing district, ""Big Island"" of Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium-Light"|"High-toned, delicate (almost too) aroma: flowers, caramel, pipe tobacco. A bit sharp and astringent in the cup, but with a richly rounding caramel character and fine floral top notes. The caramel settles toward chocolate in the finish."
"Kona Mountain Estate"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"87"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Kona growing district, ""Big Island"" of Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium-Light"|"Simple, rather subdued aroma: cherry and chocolate notes. In the cup rich, pungent and sweet, but aromatically simple: dried cherries, a hint of chocolate, perhaps suggestions of merlot-like red wine."
"100% Kona Pau Hana Estate Organic"|"Pele Plantations"|"88"|"Honaunau"|"Hawaii"|"Kona growing district, ""Big Island"" of Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium"|"Classic aroma: cleanly high-toned, slightly acidy, with flowers, peach, and a hint of milk chocolate. In the cup sweetly and brightly acidy, with continued floral, peach and black currant notes. The flavor drops off in a rather disappointing finish."
"Kona Fancy"|"A&E Custom Coffee Roasters"|"88"|"Amherst"|"New Hampshire"|"Kona growing district, ""Big Island"" of Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium-Light"|"Rich aroma: semi-sweet chocolate and suggestions of apple, with floral notes at the top. In the cup rather big-bodied and rich, with continuing distinct floral top notes and a rather dominating, roundly tart acidity that nearly overwhelms but still allows further suggestions of chocolate, ripe tomato, orange and cedar."
"Kona Peaberry Medium Roast"|"Bay View Farm"|"92"|"Honaunau"|"Hawaii"|"South Kona growing district, ""Big Island"" of Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Hawaii"|"Medium-Light"|"Roundly delicate aroma: chocolate and caramel notes with suggestions of flowers and ripe tomato. In the cup silky mouthfeel and a classic profile: tart fruitiness enveloped in a giddy sweetness that harbors continued hints of chocolate and flowers. Clean, sweet – almost sugary – finish."
"National Wildlife Blend (K-Cup)"|"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters"|"85"|"Waterbury"|"Vermont"|"Central and South America"|"South_America"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a “K-Cup” capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): A coffee either pleasingly subtle and delicate or disappointingly subdued and shallow depending on taste and expectation. Caramel, flowers and a hint of smoke or perhaps cinnamon in the aroma. In the cup gently acidy, light-bodied but silky in mouthfeel and mild in flavor, with hints of caramel, cocoa, pear and sweet flowering grass. Very sweet but simple finish."
"Papua New Guinea"|"Atomic Cafe Coffee Roasters"|"86"|"Beverly"|"Massachusetts"|"Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Most cups of this sample were very sweet in aroma and flavor, with soft earth tones (think the odor of freshly fallen, moist leaves that have just begun to compost), and pleasingly round cherry, cocoa and caramel notes. Unfortunately one cup of five was very, very foul tasting, probably owing to a bad bean called a “stinker,” so we deducted 4 points from a coffee that otherwise might merit a 90."
"Papua New Guinea"|"Intelligentsia Coffee"|"87"|"Chicago"|"Illinois"|"Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Light"|"Softly sweet-toned, rather simple aroma – raisin and chocolate notes. In the cup a lean but rather silky mouthfeel, with continued raisin and sweet pipe tobacco notes and a continued lean toward milk chocolate. Simple, straightforward finish with a shimmer of astringency in the long."
"Papua New Guinea"|"Zocalo Coffee House"|"88"|"San Leandro"|"California"|"Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Simple but deep aroma, with resonant raisiny chocolate tones. In the cup lean-bodied, delicate, fundamentally sweet and rather lush but dryly smoky with a hint of fruit that reads as white wine or grapefruit. Concludes simply but richly."
"Organic Papua New Guinea"|"The Supreme Bean"|"88"|"North Hollywood"|"California"|"Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Deep, sweet-toned, buttery aroma with a spicy, cedary chocolate and a hint of fruit, pear perhaps. In the cup delicately robust, with a roundly lush but continuing spicy, cedary, almost black-peppery chocolate and a suggestion of coconut, the sweet processed kind. Roundly rich finish."
"New Guinea"|"Little City Coffee Roaster"|"88"|"Austin"|"Texas"|"Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Very sweet, caramelly aroma with milk chocolate notes and hints of earth and cedar. In the cup richly acidy, with continued caramel and milk chocolate notes. Rather limited in nuance but not a lazy cup; a simple, straightforwardly pleasing gesture."
"Private Reserve Papua New Guinea"|"Community Coffee"|"89"|"Baton Rouge"|"Louisiana"|"Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Light"|"Sweetly smoky, cedary aroma with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup a particularly full body and creamy mouthfeel, sweetly and richly acidy, but with limited nuance – hints of cedar and tart cherry, perhaps a continuing suggestion of semi-sweet chocolate. Simple but sweetly rich finish."
"Fair-Trade Organic New Guinea"|"Surf City Coffee"|"90"|"Aptos"|"California"|"Okapa Valley, Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Dark"|"Softly low-toned fruit – bananas, semi-sweet chocolate – with a twist of cedar in the aroma. In the cup sweetly earthy with a fruit that displays a hint of ferment. Together this package reads as an earthy orange or raisin with a lean toward semi-sweet chocolate. Quietly rich, slightly rough finish with a pleasingly persistent earthy chocolate character."
"Papua New Guinea Arokara"|"Paradise Roasters"|"90"|"Anoka"|"Minnesota"|"Kainantu district, Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Sweetly smoky, deep-toned aroma with fruit notes that suggest a sort of chocolaty papaya. In the cup deeply and fundamentally sweet, with spicy, smoky tones and a lush fruit that again suggested chocolate, but with a sweet grapefruit cast. Clean, rich, long finish."
"Beemer’s Papua New Guinea"|"Island Joe's Gourmet Coffee"|"91"|"Key West"|"Florida"|"Highlands of Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium"|"Delicate aroma with softly pungent cedar and sweet tomato notes. In the cup gently and crisply acidy, with distinct floral notes and coffee fruit that reads as a tart, chocolate-toned cherry. A simple but very pure coffee expression."
"Papua New Guinea Bunum Wo Peaberry"|"Caffe Artigiano-49th Parallel Roasters"|"91"|"Vancouver"|"British Columbia"|"Wahgi Valley, Western Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Light"|"Delicate but deep aroma, with chocolate, pipe tobacco and leather notes. In the cup earthy but richly sweet, almost sugary, with cherry fruit notes that acquire a chocolate depth in the profoundly sweet finish."
"Papua New Guinea – Kimel Estate"|"The Roasterie"|"93"|"Kansas City"|"Missouri"|"Wahgi Valley, Western Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea"|"Papua_New_Guinea"|"Asia_Indonesia"|"Medium-Light"|"Sweet-toned, delicate aroma with butter notes and hints of chocolate and Mediterranean spice. Even sweeter in the cup, still delicate but rich, softly acidy and quietly complex with distinct floral notes and a crisp, subtle fruit that suggests Riesling table wine or perhaps black currant. The fruit notes turn toward cocoa in the long, continuing sweet finish."
"Bolivia Calama Marka Cup of Excellence Prize Winner"|"Paradise Roasters"|"90"|"Anoka"|"Minnesota"|"Calama growing region, Bolivia"|"Bolivia"|"South_America"|"Medium"|"Heady, intense aroma: milk chocolate, leather, flowers, sweet lemon and tomato. In the cup a richly tart acidity dominates, rounded by sweetness but bold and uncompromising. Lemon and sweet tomato notes lean toward chocolate. As the cup cools the acidity softens toward a clean, sweet finish, bracing but astringency free."
