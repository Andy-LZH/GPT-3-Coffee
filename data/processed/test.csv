"Peru, Lambayeque region, Peru","Evaluated as espresso. This delicate, gently bright espresso attracted gently expressed support from both Ken (91) and his co-taster (90). Crisp, hazelnut-toned aroma; light but lively, effervescent mouthfeel. Ripe lemon and caramel in flavor and finish, where the co-taster also found a tickle of sweet black pepper. Maintained presence nicely in three parts milk, where the co-taster found it “immensely sweet and clean with lemon character.”"
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Evaluated as espresso. Ken (92) showed considerably more enthusiasm for this intense dried-in-the-fruit profile than his only mildly respectful co-taster (89). The co-taster associated the usual fermented fruit notes with wine and spiced cider, Ken with bourbon whisky (which he likes). The co-taster found the fermented fruit notes complicated by “sweet hay and malt,” Ken by a more decisive “fresh-cut cedar.” Ken rated the lightly syrupy, perhaps buttery mouthfeel a bit higher than did his co-taster. Both found the shot pleasantly chocolaty in three parts milk, additionally nuanced by malt for the co-taster, by cedar for Ken."
"Bolivia, Caranavi Province, La Paz Department, Bolivia","Evaluated as espresso. Ken rated this softly bright espresso three points higher at 92 than the co-taster did at 89. Ken simply seems to have found more going on and liked what he found better: a fuller mouthfeel, a slightly more complex set of aromatics (for Ken citrus, honey, flowers, chocolate; for his co-taster taster citrus, praline, pear), a longer finish and a more complex, persistent flavor in milk."
"Guatemala, El Quiche Department, south central Guatemala","Evaluated as espresso. Ken (91) and his co-taster (91) recorded identical scores and very similar readings for this lively, balanced espresso: in aroma and flavor sweetly tart fruit (orange, lemon, kiwi) rounded by flowers for Ken and “sweet pea” for the co-taster; smooth, lightly syrupy mouthfeel; most impressively a very sweet finish with chocolate and cinnamon suggestions. Delicately chocolaty in three parts milk (“pure milk chocolate” according to the co-taster)."
"El_Salvador, Volcan de Santa Ana regioin, El Salvador","Evaluated as espresso. Ken (93) and his co-taster (88) went rather different ways on this deep, sweet, brandyish, lightly herby dried-in-the-fruit profile. Ken enjoyed the overripe, fermenty fruit notes in aroma and cup; his co-taster was not greatly impressed. Both had good things to say about the mouthfeel (co-taster: “huge and enveloping”); on the other hand, neither were impressed by the rather astringent finish. Ken admired the impact in three parts milk (“juicy and rich”) more than did his co-taster, who found it pleasantly berryish but a bit too tart."
"Costa_Rica, West Valley growing region, Costa Rica","Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (91) and his co-taster (90) admired a gently bright, citrus-and-berry character in the small cup; Ken found distinct floral suggestions as well. A dark chocolate note emerged clearly and perhaps surprisingly in the finish. Citrus, chocolate and (for Ken) flowers all carried with grace into three parts milk."
"Ethiopia, Sidamo (also Sidama) growing region, southern Ethiopia","Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (93) and his co-taster (91) enjoyed this crisp and rather cleanly wine- and brandy-toned dried-in-the-fruit profile, though Ken enjoyed it two rating points more. The co-taster read “berries, pineapple and dried fruits” in the small cup; Ken’s associations ran to parallel descriptors of grape, orange, apricot and fresh-cut cedar. Both admired the shot in three parts milk, citing a deep, balanced sweetness that for Ken was pleasantly viscous and “banana-like.”"
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia","Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (93) and his co-taster (91) admired the wine-like intensity of this dried-in-the-fruit profile, though Ken read more complexity, in particular floral top notes, in flavor and finish. Both tasters cited a creamy mouthfeel and consistent finish. Especially impressive in three parts milk, where the shot bloomed with a complex expression of fruit-toned chocolate."
"Guatemala, Alta Verapaz Department, north-central Guatemala","Evaluated as espresso. In the small cup both Ken (91) and his co-taster (92) admired the bright, refreshing fruit (strawberry in particular) rounded by a fudgy chocolate, an impressively syrupy mouthfeel, and a flavor-saturated but clean finish. Vivacious in three parts milk: orange zest and caramel."
"Ethiopia, Kochere District, southern Ethiopia","Evaluated as espresso. Ken (91) liked this bright, zesty espresso; his co-taster (92) liked it even better. Both admired the citrus and floral vivacity of the aroma and flavor. Ken and his co-taster both accepted the smooth though rather light mouthfeel as an appropriate complement to the lively aromatics; both enjoyed the emergence of a lower-toned fruit (fig, roasted cacao nib) in the finish. Ken found the sweet-citrus impact in three parts milk a bit more pleasing than his co-taster did, though the co-taster offered an apt descriptor for it: “key lime pie.”"
"Colombia, Valle de Cauca Department, western Colombia","Evaluated as espresso. Ken (93) and his co-taster (93) both admired this roundly and very discreetly roast-influenced espresso. They found the aroma deeply pungent, the flavor complex with a wide range of sensation: raisin, apricot, flowers, fresh-cut cedar, “crisp, fresh berry” (co-taster). Ken particularly admired the full, syrupy (for the co-taster buttery) mouthfeel. Long, sweet, cedary (Ken’s word) finish. The co-taster in particular made a case for this espresso in three parts milk, where it showed chocolate and a fresh, sugar-cane-like sweetness."
"Kenya, Nyeri growing region, south-central Kenya","Evaluated as espresso. Crisp, finely structured, quietly distinctive. Dark chocolate and a shifty, anise-toned fruit (orange, blackberry, grape) dominate in aroma and small cup, with backgrounded complications of cedar and butter. Creamy, full yet buoyant mouthfeel.

Lean though smooth mouthfeel. Floral notes in particular carry into a remarkably long, complex finish. Flavor carries intact into two parts milk, where a hint of grapefruity acidity is juxtaposed with the milky sweetness."

"Colombia, Colombia","Complex dark-roast character in aroma and cup: deep, rich, dark chocolate with citrus top notes (lemon, grapefruit) and pungent, cedary midtones. The fine aromatics are partly betrayed by a rather leanish mouthfeel and finish."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Crisp, gently charred sweetness (think campfire marshmallow) in aroma and cup, with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and a shimmer of bright, surprising lemon. Roast-muted acidity, light but silky mouthfeel. Some chocolaty sweetness persists to lighten a rather roast-heavy finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia","Attractive floral, nut, lemon and vanilla notes, but rather muted, especially in the aroma. Round, gentle acidity; unusually buttery mouthfeel. The nut note hints at chocolate in a sweet, rich finish."
"Indonesia, Sumatra, Indonesia","Impressive aroma: sweet-toned, deep, roundly roasty, with cedar, orange and smoky dark chocolate nuance. Quiet acidity.

The chocolate tendencies in particular persist in a sweet, clean finish."
"Thailand, Northern Thailand","Roasted nut and a rich, pruny dark chocolate dominates in aroma and cup. Soft but resonant acidity, silky mouthfeel. Flavor fades a bit in the finish, but generally the cup sweetens and deepens as it cools, a good sign."
"Honduras, Octopeque Province, Honduras","Gently and sweetly bright, delicately balanced. Milk chocolate and plum-like fruit with hints of vanilla and fresh leather in aroma and cup. Softly tart acidity; silky mouthfeel. Sweet though very slightly drying and astringent in the finish."

"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia","Tart, zesty, complex: lemon, fir, spicy tea rose, a hint of nut-toned cocoa in both aroma and cup. Sweet but tartly assertive acidity; light, leanish mouthfeel. Flavor rounds toward cocoa in a finish that some may find bracing and others too astringently drying."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia","Crisp, complex. Fresh-cut fir, cherryish fruit, ripe citrus, a hint of cocoaish chocolate in aroma and cup. Richly tart acidity; smooth, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Long, impressive finish, tart but sweet, alive with lemony cocoa nuance."

"Mexico, Oaxaca, Mexico","Crisp, cocoa-toned nut and dark malted barley notes in aroma and cup. Smooth, balanced acidity; lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Flavor carries nicely into a clean, sweet finish."

"Kenya, Kiambu District, Kenya","Intense and deep yet delicately balanced, saturated from aroma through finish with famous, sweetly tart Kenya black currant sensation, a layering of ripe lemon, honey, fresh-cut fir, blackberry, flowers and, depending on one’s memory bank, probably much more. Gently rich acidity, lightly silky mouthfeel. The black currant note rings on far into the finish."
"Guatemala, Quiche Department, Guatemala","Quietly balanced, sweetly tart: flowers and orangy citrus, a hint of cedar carry from aroma to cup. Round, soft acidity; lightly syrupy mouthfeel; the tart sweetness extends into a long finish."

A slight hint of sweet ferment encourages a deep plum-like and banana-like fruit and dark chocolate complicated by a pungent hint of fir. Rich, low-toned acidity; lightly syrupy mouthfeel.

Mouthfeel is smooth if slightly lean; cleanly rich, straightforward finish. At best in two parts milk, where the chocolate softens and rounds to fill out the milk nicely, complicated by continued suggestions of lemon and fir."
"Colombia, Cauca Department, southern Colombia","Intense, complex, inimitably distinctive aromatics and flavor: crisp cocoa, cherryish fruit, brandy, spicy tea rose, fresh pipe tobacco.

"Burundi, Kayanza Province, Burundi","Rich fruit-toned aroma turns pungent in the cup, displaying an intense black-currant-laced chocolate with hints of flowers and lemon. Soft but penetrating acidity and silky mouthfeel. Dark chocolate in particular lingers in the sweet-toned finish."

"Indonesia, Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia","Notes of nut, milk chocolate and aromatic wood dominate the aroma. In the cup the aromatics intensify, highlighted by rich, albeit slightly musty tones of dark chocolate, toasted almond and suggestions of citrus fruit and baking spices.

"Indonesia, Aceh growing region, northwestern Sumatra, Indonesia","Sweetly and richly pungent: cedar, grapefruit, freshly turned earth in aroma and cup. Rich, roundly bright acidity; medium body; silky mouthfeel. The citrus turns orangy in a fine, flavor-saturated finish."
"Burundi, Kayanza Province, Burundi","Evaluated as espresso. Deep, dark-chocolaty aroma turns crisper in the small cup, which co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) read as dry, “limeish” and floral, Ken (90) as more orangy and anise-like. Rich, dry, very long finish with a clear citrus edge. Two parts milk revives a delicate and cocoaish version of the chocolate, rounding the citrus and flowers."
"Peru, Chirinos, Peru","Evaluated as espresso. Although Ken (90) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) produced identical ratings, they read this coffee a bit differently, with Sean emphasizing its brightish citrus and floral tendencies while Ken added dark chocolate and hint of brandy. Sean’s citrus inclined more toward lemon and lime, Ken’s toward a deeper-toned orange. Both read the small cup as medium in weight though slightly lean in mouthfeel, but admired the sample’s performance in two parts milk, finding it smooth, creamy, complex: berry, flowers, lemony cocoa."
"Mexico, Nayarit, Mexico","Evaluated as espresso. Co-taster Sean Kohmescher (92) and Ken (88) split on this coffee and how to read its deep, ferment-toned fruit. Sean enjoyed the distinctive character of the fruit: “stone-fruited chocolate” with a hint of grapefruit. Ken read the same fruit but also picked up nagging musty/salty tendencies. Two parts milk smoothed things out a bit for Ken, developing a chocolaty sweetness, though Sean remained more committed here also, praising the shot’s “light, sweet, berries and cream” performance in milk."
"Taiwan, Taiwan","Evaluated as espresso. Ken, at 92, liked this unusual sample better than co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) did, perhaps because Ken read more depth in the aromatics and flavor. Sean stopped at citrus, honey and caramel in aroma and small cup whereas Ken added dark chocolate and pungent fir. Ken also found a bit more going on in the finish, with flowers complicating a deep, bananaish chocolate. In two parts milk Ken and Sean read the cup about the same although applying slightly different language, with Sean citing lemon and ”light caramel” and Ken a “lemony chocolate.”"
"Colombia, Huila Department, Colombia","Evaluated as espresso. Gently tart, lemony, delicate. Co-taster Sean Kohmescher (91) was a bit more lavish in his descriptors than Ken (91): “bright citrus” in the aroma; more sweet citrus, vanilla, hints of flowers and honey in the small cup; vanilla and cranberries in the finish. Ken pretty much left it at lemon and flowers. The lemon dominated in two parts milk, but the milk coaxed out a sweet chocolate to round and support it."
"Ethiopia, Wellega, Ethiopia","Evaluated as espresso. Complex dried-in-the-fruit profile. “Berries and more berries” in the aroma for co-taster Sean Kohmescher (91). For Ken (91) berries plus a lot of other notes: brandy, malty dark chocolate, fresh-cut cedar. In the small cup Sean felt the aromatics turned crisper and drier: lemon, flowers, green bitters (as in asparagus); Ken read the same rounder, brandyish, cedary berries-and-chocolate notes as he had in the aroma. Both found the body medium and the mouthfeel silky. Rather crisp in two parts milk; cocoa for Ken, lemon and flowers for Sean."
"Brazil, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Evaluated as espresso. Although both Ken (94) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) lavished a bundle of descriptors on this complex and challenging espresso, the real issue was how much to honor a pungent, musky character as it plays out in a well-pulled espresso. Both Ken and Sean were puzzled by the unusual aroma, but Sean, as he followed it into the cup, found it pleasing but just a bit edgy, perhaps musty, whereas Ken enthusiastically read it rich with the sort of pungent, earthy grapefruit character one finds in the best Sumatras. In two parts milk Sean found this flavor complex “musky” and “antique”; for Ken it was suavely nut-like."
"Burundi, Burundi","Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (93) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (93) admired sweet-toned floral and bright lemony suggestions broadened by leather-like, musky bottom notes. Medium to full body, syrupy mouthfeel. Cocoaish chocolate and hints of lemon and flowers carry pleasingly into two parts milk."
"Bolivia, Caranavi growing region, Bolivia","Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (94) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (94) remarked on and enjoyed distinct and subtly unusual roasted nut and fudgy (Sean’s term) chocolate notes in aroma and small cup. Also some fruit complication (orange for Ken, berry for Sean). Medium to full body, smooth mouthfeel, and a superb finish that just keeps coming, carrying subtly transforming flavor notes far into the reaches of sensory memory. Fades just a bit in two parts milk, but remains pleasing and balanced."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia","Evaluated as espresso. Co-taster Sean Kohmescher (94) and Ken (94) both admired this sample’s refined complexity and chocolate-toned depth. Ken cited crisp fir and lemon complication, whereas Sean’s reading of nuance inclined more toward berry and wine. Both found the sample slightly more impressive in the small cup than in milk, but nevertheless honored its sweet chocolaty balance in two parts milk, nuanced (for Ken) by hints of flowers and lemon."
"Nicaragua, Nicaragua","Evaluated as espresso. Great depth and range of sensation. Between Ken (94) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (94) about a dozen aroma/flavor descriptors surfaced, most circling around fruit (stone fruit, wine grape, berry) and nut-toned dark chocolate. Medium to full body; silky/syrupy mouthfeel; crisply dry, flavor-saturated finish. Balanced, chocolaty and berryish in two parts milk."
"Guatemala, Chimaltenango Department, Guatemala","Aromatics expand and deepen in subtle but extraordinary flavor and finish: buttery milk chocolate; sweet, lily-like flowers; ripe orange, all resonating in a long, impeccably clean but rich finish. Round, vibrant acidity; syrupy mouthfeel."
"Kenya, Kirinyaga region, south-central Kenya","Complex and almost giddily sweet-toned. Flowers, crisp blackcurrant, lemon, blackberry, roasted nut carry from aroma to cup. Sweetly tart, refined acidity; light body but very smooth, silky mouthfeel. Resonant, flavor-saturated short finish simplifies just a bit in the long."
"Burundi, Northern Burundi","Low-toned, balanced aroma: nut, ripe citrus, flowers. Tart, lemony acidity; lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Aromatics turn rounder and riper in the cup: sweet citrus, gently tart berry, nut-toned cocoa. The cocoa and lemon in particular linger in a rich, clean finish."
"Colombia, Huila Department, Colombia","Crisp, delicately bright aroma: orange, a hint of apricot. In the cup rich acidity, syrupy mouthfeel, almost sugary sweetness, with continued orange and apricot notes and an orange-blossom floral hint. Clean, rich finish."
"Bolivia, La Paz Department, Bolivia","Soft, sweet-toned aroma: fir, milk chocolate. In the cup gentle but impressively deep acidity, lightly syrupy mouthfeel, continued balance of pungent fir with roundly sweet milk chocolate and apricot notes. Gently rich finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia","Lemon-zest brightness and pungent fir in the aroma. The lemony character rounds in the acidity and the cup, where it is deepened and complicated by a crisp, floral-toned cocoa. Light but smoothly silky mouthfeel; cleanly sweet and flavor-saturated finish."
"Indonesia, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia","Very complex, rather edgy Sumatra. Pruny dark chocolate, cherry, brandy, fir in the aroma. Quietly rich acidity; full, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Woody, sweet, herby character in the cup, reminiscent of sassafras perhaps. Floral top notes, continuing dark chocolate and cherryish fruit. Very sweet in the finish, with ongoing floral and wood notes."
"Tanzania, Mt. Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania","Pungently sweet aroma: ripe lemony citrus, backgrounded nut. Round, soft acidity, medium body, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Nut moves forward in the cup, complicated pleasingly by dry berry, lemon, flowers, fir. Sweet-toned finish, with some flavor persistence."
"Panama, Chiriqui Province, Panama","Soft floral and citrus tones in the aroma complicate in the cup with juicier citrus and crisp cocoa. Soft, fruit-toned acidity; silky mouthfeel. Dry chocolate in a relatively short finish."
"Rwanda, Rwanda","Soft, round aroma: muted notes of lemon and flowers. In the cup balanced, gently tart acidity, lightish body, silky mouthfeel, continuing lemon and flowers. Some flavor carries into a clean, simple finish."
"Colombia, Huila Department, Colombia","Quiet introduction: soft notes of fir, flowers and milk chocolate in the aroma. All of this soars in the cup, intense yet perfectly balanced. The floral notes, which take back seat to the milk chocolate and gently pungent fir in the cup, move forward again in a very sweet, clean finish. Delicately tart acidity, silky mouthfeel."
"Colombia, Huila Department, Colombia","Crisply balanced with a shifting, tight-knit complexity. Flowers, nut, fir, and a dark chocolaty fruit in aroma and cup.  The flowers and chocolate carry long into the finish. Gentle acidity, silkily smooth mouthfeel."
"Burundi, Kayanza Province, Burundi","Brightly acidy and authoritative. Citrus- and floral-toned aroma broadens and deepens in the cup, taking on a tartly sweet mandarin orange-like quality. Intense, flower-toned acidity. The sweet citrus character gently lingers far into the long finish."
"Indonesia, Eastern Java","A tactful dark roast develops sweetness and a pungent depth in a subtly complex coffee. Dark chocolate, lemon, cherryish fruit, spicy nut. Rich, roast-rounded acidity, smooth mouthfeel. Clean finishing, though flavor fades rather quickly."
"Colombia, Colombia","(As brewed in a Senseo single-serve brewing device to produce a 4+-ounce serving): Good sweetness, but otherwise muted acidity, lean mouthfeel, woody flavor with a soapy/salty edge, empty finish. Probably produced from a mildly defective green coffee, with the mildly medicinal character of the coffee intensified by the tendency of pod brewing generally and our sample Senseo machine in particular to mute aromatics."
"Indonesia, Sumatra, Indonesia; other undisclosed origins","(As brewed in a Senseo single-serve brewing device to produce a 4+-ounce serving): Some genuine Sumatra character lifts its head out of a woody astringency probably related to paper pod brewing generally and the water quality of our sample Senseo machine in particular. On the positive side, pruny sweetness and a hint of earthy, butterscotchy Sumatra pungency in aroma and cup."
"India, India","(As brewed in a Nespresso single-serve brewing device to produce a 4-ounce serving): This blend was designed for brewing as espresso rather than a longer black coffee, accounting for the dullish acidity, but otherwise impressive in the 4-ounce format: round, deep, chocolate-and roasted-nut-toned in aroma and cup; fat body and smooth mouthfeel. Flavor fades in an otherwise sweet, rich finish."
"Colombia, Colombia","(As brewed in a Bunn My Café single-serve brewing device to produce a 6-ounce serving): Rather lively, savory-sweet profile with ripe tomato and dark chocolate suggestions carrying from aroma through cup to finish. Smooth mouthfeel, lemony acidity. The aromatics are only fully expressed in the cup; the aroma is a bit muted in intensity and the finish pleasing but short."
"Colombia, Colombia","(As brewed in a Keurig B70 Platinum single-serve brewing device using a “K-Cup” capsule to produce 6-ounce serving): Sweet-toned, soft, balanced, with a grapy, Riesling-like fruit and hints of dark chocolate and flowers. Muted aroma and short (if rich) finish. Best in the cup: bright, delicate acidity, lightly syrupy mouthfeel and gently complex flavor."
"Burundi, Kayanza Province, Burundi","Round notes of cherry and tea rose in the aroma. Gentle fruit-toned acidity, lightly syrupy mouthfeel and delicate yet deep flavors that continue the spicy floral aromatic theme with complications of plum, cherry and sweet chocolate. Chocolate in particular is sustained in the sweet-toned finish."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Papua New Guinea","Hints of caramel, stone fruit and baking spice in the aroma. A pungent but balanced cup, with a deep fresh-cut fir character complicated by spice-toned chocolate and stone fruit that grow more prominent as the cup cools. Rich dark chocolate persists in the finish."
"Kenya, Nyeri growing region, south-central Kenya","Big, deep, syrupy. The aroma and flavor express the complexity of the pure coffee fruit: sweetly tart, lemon- and cherry-toned, with a crisp, backgrounded nut and fresh-cut fir, all of which soften in a long, resonant finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia","Intense, unusual profile, dominated by a citrus and molasses character that suggests both moist pipe tobacco and sweet black tea. Roundly rich acidity; lightly syrupy mouthfeel. The distinctive flavor complex lingers in the deep, rich finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia","Evaluated as espresso. Rich, buttery aroma: ripe lemon, cherry, a hint of fresh-cut fir. In the small cup medium body, smooth mouthfeel, crisply complex flavor: the fruit and fir notes resolve toward a dark chocolate with a hint of anise. Deep, sweet, dark-chocolaty finish. The chocolate sensation rounds and softens in two parts milk; think a lemon-toned milk chocolate."
"Ecuador, Loja Province, Ecuador","Intense aroma combining notes of peach, flowers and nut. The sweet peach and floral tones soften in the cup, complicated by suggestions of tart lemon and bittersweet chocolate. Citrusy acidity; lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Flavors simplify in a walnut-edged finish."
"Hawaii, Kona growing region, """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","Gentle, balanced aroma and flavor. Soft notes of sweet citrus and stone fruit in the aroma become more pronounced in the cup, with added floral complications. Fruit-toned acidity, silky mouthfeel and rich finish."

"Rwanda, Southern Province, Rwanda","Complex and distinctive aromatics. Intense floral notes – a sort of spicy tea rose – and bright, wine-like fruit carry from aroma to finish, with some lime-like citrus and even a little chocolate. Tart, zesty acidity, full but leanish-textured mouthfeel. Sweetness overrides a very mild astringency in the finish."
"Brazil, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Very deep, sweet, cherry-toned. Additional hints of brandy, minty dark chocolate, anise, cedar, flowers in aroma and small cup. Syrupy mouthfeel; chocolate in particular lingers in a richly long finish. The complexity mutes in two parts milk, though the minty chocolate persists."
"Rwanda, Northern Province, Rwanda","Sweet, intense, cherry-toned, with a clear nut note that turns rather woody in the cup. Nevertheless, a rich sweetness resonates from aroma through finish. Round, deep acidity."
"Bolivia, La Paz Department, Bolivia","Complex yet delicate. Sweet lemony citrus and flowers overlay notes of brown sugar and rich almond in aroma and cup. Fine, crisply fruit-toned acidity and lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Deeper nut-toned flavors carry into the long, bittersweet finish."

"Colombia, Colombia. All coffee of the Arabica species","Steamed wood (boiling water poured on board), caramel and a hint of dark chocolate in the aroma. The acidity hints at brightness, but lapses into a dull bitterness as the cup cools. Lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Boiled, or maybe burned, wood in the cup, rounded by caramel and the barest suggestion of dark chocolate. Sweet in the finish though quite astringent."
"Colombia, Colombia. All coffee of the Arabica species","In the aroma faint but complex suggestions of butter, nut, fruit and dark chocolate peer out from under a burned or steamed wood sensation. Acidity is bitterish with some hints of tart sweetness. The body is full in weight, slightly leanish in mouthfeel. The burned or steam-scorched wood sensation dominates in the cup, sitting on continued, potentially pleasing hints of fruit and dark chocolate. Clean short finish: sweet, rich, simple, but a mildly astringent version of the scorched wood note reasserts itself in the long."
"Colombia, Colombia. All coffee of the Arabica species","Sweet, caramelly aroma with a hint of nut-toned chocolate. Balanced though flat acidity; lightly syrupy mouthfeel. In the cup almost cloyingly sweet: nut, caramel, a hint of raisiny fruit. Clean, rather rich finish when hot. Generally the cup deteriorated as it cooled, turning slightly sourish with a very faint off-note in the finish that suggested sulfur."

"Ethiopia, Sidamo growing region, southern Ethiopia","Rich, brandy-like notes dominate in this classic dried-in-the-fruit coffee, complicated and enriched by cherry, orange and floral nuance.

Long, peanut-buttery sweetness in the finish, turning slightly astringent as the cup cools."
"India, Southern India","Smooth, rich, big-bodied, almost sugary sweet, with aromatic wood notes and a mild though distinct fruit ferment that hits raisin squarely and shades into dark chocolate. The sweetly rich finish grows very slightly tight in the long."
"India, Karnataka State, southern India","Aroma of fermented fruit that reads pleasantly as sweet berry, with soft wine and nut suggestions. In the cup bright toned acidity, medium-to-full body and smooth mouthfeel.  Tart cherry softens and rounds toward the sweet berry noted in the aroma, balanced by pungent suggestions of aromatic wood. Fruit-toned sweetness carries into the long finish."
"India, Karnataka State, southern India","A delicate, balanced, sweet-toned profile. Nut, raisin, and a hint of aromatic wood in the aroma.

Sweet short finish, perhaps very slightly woody in the long."
"India, Nilgiris, southern India","Sweet-toned, balanced, quietly complete cup. Gently pungent acidity, silky mouthfeel. Tight-knit complexity: suggestions of nut, flowers, stone fruit, chocolate, lemon. Tightens a bit in a still sweet finish."

"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Rich, deep aroma with pungent cedar-toned fruit notes: fig perhaps, or prune. In the cup quiet, balanced acidity, fullish body, continued mildly pungent, fig-like fruit notes that take on a dark chocolate character in the finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","A roundly bright cup, with aromatic and flavor notes of flowers combined with hints of stone fruit, baking spices and toast. A gracefully clean, very sweet and long finish with a pleasing toasty and caramel-like character."

In the cup round and delicately melodic: gently rich acidity, silky to lightly syrupy mouthfeel, cherryish fruit with continued hints of cedar and night flowers. Balanced, slightly dry finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","A pungent fruit aroma with hints of flowers, cedar and red currant. In the cup, nicely balanced acidity, a lightly syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of peach and lemon that lean toward chocolate. The fruit-toned chocolate grows more distinct and lingers in the finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Big, fruity sweetness and underlying bouillon-like savory notes carry from aroma through finish in this nicely balanced natural or dried-in-the-fruit coffee. Impressively syrupy body, rich acidity, crisp chocolate and a dry cherryish, slightly salty fruit complicate cup and finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Sweet and deep in the aroma, with suggestions of flowers, butter, cedar. Smooth, rounded acidity and syrupy body in the cup, with continued floral notes, a cocoaish chocolate and richly tart fruit. Simple but long, resonant finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","An aromatically rich coffee, with round jasmine notes and hints of mixed berry fruitiness. Balanced acidity, soft mouthfeel and a delicate lemony flavor, with hints of flowers and sweet toned fruit that deepen and become more opulent as the cup cools. The bitter-sweet, flavor-saturated finish fades but sweetens further in the long."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Blueberry-toned aroma with hints of cherry, flowers and baking spices. Bright, fruity acidity and a smooth mouthfeel with a complex fruit character in the cup bringing up associations ranging from plums and peaches to berries and citrus. Dry, sweet finish that becomes sweeter and slightly nutty in the long."

The flavor is dominated by voluptuous notes of night flowers, orange, tart cherry, nut, all of which coast into a long, deep, clean finish."
"Nicaragua, Matagalpa, Nicaragua","Balanced aroma with soft notes of pipe tobacco, vanilla, sweet aromatic wood and suggestions of fruit. The fruit becomes more pronounced in the bright-toned acidity. A graceful cup, with a lightly syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of orange, grapefruit, fir, and a touch of chocolate that sweetens in the finish."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Delicately complex aroma of flowers, tangerine and honey. In the cup, smooth mouthfeel, balanced, richly floral-toned acidity, and elegant notes of orange, lemon and yes, more flowers. Finishes cleanly with the flavor nuances lingering softly."
"Mexico, Southern Mexico","Gently sweet aroma with hints of wood and molasses.

Some sweetness persists in the finish, though it fades rather quickly."
"Tanzania, Gombe growing region, western Tanzania","Rich, deep, balanced coffee with tight-knit complexity in aroma and cup: night flowers, orange, berry, raisin. Delicately bright acidity, medium body, simple but cleanly rich finish."
"Guatemala, San Marcos growing region, southwestern Guatemala","Intense, sweet-toned aroma: cherryish fruit, hints of orange and flowers. In the cup rich, rounded acidity, fullish body, and continued cherry- and orange-toned fruit complicated by a dry, cocoaish chocolate. Simple, sweet finish."
"Hawaii, Ka'u growing district, southwestern corner of the """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","Light-roasted, but brought along just enough to develop the delicate richness of a pure, subtle coffee. Gently pungent, orange-toned citrus in the aroma turns lushly orange-blossomy in the cup, complicated by a hint of cocoaish chocolate. Rich, flavor-saturated finish."
"El_Salvador, La Libertad Department, El Salvador","Soft aromatic notes of cinnamon, vanilla, citrus and toast. A very light roast develops brightness in the cup and simple but delicately nuanced flavors. Flowers and lime at first, deepening and sweetening to round, milky chocolate, with a gently smooth mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly, with a mild hint of sweet chocolate."
"Indonesia, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia","Plenty of sweet aromatic wood and soft fruit-tones in the aroma, with a hint of honey. Full body, creamy mouthfeel, balanced fruity acidity, and complex flavors of grapefruit, flowering grasses, earth, aromatic wood and tropical fruit. Long, dry finish with deep earth and wood notes pleasantly persisting in the long."
"Kenya, Kiambu growing region, south-central Kenya","Densely sweet aroma, with soft hints of stone fruit, citrus and flowers. Brightly balanced in the cup. Medium body. Tart lime notes in front fade and sweeten to floral, blackberry and pungent cedar. The cedar note combines with bitter-sweet chocolate in the long, gently astringent finish."
"Ethiopia, Sidamo growing region, southern Ethiopia","Intense floral, honey and blueberry-like aroma. Delicate yet sustained flavors of night flowers, lemon, peach and strawberry, with a lightly syrupy mouthfeel and rounded acidity. Finishes cleanly, with hints of the sweet floral and fruit notes found in the cup softly lingering in the long."
"El_Salvador, Ahuachapan Department, El Salvador","A very slight fruit ferment both complicates and shadows the profile. A distinct orange-toned citrus and nut character dominates the aroma. In the cup round-toned acidity, syrupy mouthfeel, continued orange and nut notes sweeten and add a cocoa crispness. The finish is long and resonant, though the flavor fades rather quickly."
"Guatemala, Antigua valley, Guatemala","Sweet-toned orange and lemon aroma, with soft hints of nuts, cherry and caramel. A bright acidity is softened and rounded by a suggestion of fruit. The balance continues in the cup with sweet lemon and honey in front, fading to a pleasant nuttiness. Hints of chocolate and aromatic wood linger in the long finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","A rather wild fruit ferment reads in the aroma as deep-toned cherryish fruit with complicating hints of lemon and aromatic wood. In the cup muted acidity, fullish body, and a complexly savory-sweet fruit character suggesting brandy, cherry, and a slightly salty chocolate. Softens in a long, salty-sweet finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Intense aroma: flowers, bergamot, lemon, cocoa nib. In the cup gently tart with a lean but silky mouthfeel. The flowers carry lavishly into the cup with continued hints of lemon and bergamot and a cocoa that softens toward a dry chocolate. Clean, long, flavor-saturated finish."
"Bolivia, Caranavi growing region, Bolivia","Nut, flowers and blackberryish fruit in the balanced though slightly muted aroma. In the cup rich wine-toned acidity, silky mouthfeel, sweetly tart lemon and blackberry notes soften toward chocolate as the cup cools. The blackberry fruit nuance carries into a long, rich finish."
"Mexico, Mapastepec, Chiapas, Mexico","Very deep-toned, balanced aroma: orangy citrus, nut, a hint of chocolate. In the cup rich, slightly wine-toned acidity, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Sweet cocoa and nut notes richly dominate, with a hint of grapy fruit and a slight savory edge that balances the deep sweetness. Rich, savory-sweet, flavor-saturated finish."
"Nicaragua, Matagalpa, Nicaragua","Honey-sweet tangerine aroma, with hints of cantaloupe and strawberry. Bright fruit-toned acidity, medium body with a lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Tangy lime and lemon in front sweeten toward toast and honey, finishing cleanly with a mild suggestion of chocolate."
"Guatemala, Huehuetenango growing region, Guatemala","Very sweet-toned, cherryish, chocolate-leaning fruit in the aroma; butter and night flower complications. In the cup deeply acidy, full-bodied. The chocolate character deepens and sheds some fruit, but remains rich, sweet and buttery, with a slight herby/salty edge. The chocolate fruit outlasts a slight astringency in the finish."
"El_Salvador, Santa Ana Department, El Salvador","Complete and classic Central-American style cup, lively and delicately complex. Cherryish-chocolate fruit and a shimmering hint of flowers in the aroma. In the cup gentle acidity, tart cherry and milk chocolate notes, continuing hint of flowers. The surprisingly rich finish simplifies slightly as the cup cools."
"Mexico, Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico","Crisp, pungently sweet-toned aroma: caramel, pineapple, nut, a hint of aromatic wood. In the cup softly balanced acidity, medium body. The pungent fruit reads as a cocoaish chocolate in the cup, with hints of lavender and molasses. The cocoa in particular carries into a rich finish."
"Brazil, Sul de Minas growing region, southern Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Roundly nutty aroma, with suggestions of aromatic wood and caramel. Smooth and balanced, subtly complex. Notes of honeyed fruit, nut, cedar and orange zest. Delicate finish, with lingering hints of nut and chocolate softly lingering."
"Ethiopia, Sidamo growing region, southern Ethiopia","Intense honey-like aroma, redolent of flowers and blueberry. Delicate in the cup with a soft, lightly syrupy mouthfeel, balanced acidity and fresh flavors of ripe stone fruit, lemon, tangerine and more flowery honeyed sweetness. Finishes cleanly, developing a quiet sweet fruit-toned chocolate in the long."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Intensely pungent aroma: blueberry, cedar, hints of flowers and honey. In the cup, bright fruit-toned acidity, silky mouthfeel and a lemon-like citrus quality that sweetens to flowers and berries. Floral tones linger in the long richly sweet finish."
"El_Salvador, Santa Ana Department, El Salvador","Plush, extravagant fruit aromatics. Co-cupper Andy Newbom (89) praised the “absolutely glorious citrus and heavy florals” in the aroma; Ken (88) a – “lush fruit, flowers, a hint of cocoa.” For both the acidity was delicate and clean, the mouthfeel “buttery” (Andy). Andy energetically reported on flavor: “high notes of lemon and grapefruit that explode into raw cocoa.” However, both Ken and Andy found a slight hard sensation haunting cup and finish, dampening the explosive aromatics."
"Nicaragua, Nicaragua","Enthusiastic co-cupper Andy Newbom (89) found this deep, chocolate-leaning coffee luxurious (“sweet and heavy lidded aroma”), balanced (“all-over tongue-hugger”), and complex (“smooth and sultry dark chocolate … with a hint of lemon/orange and a dash of florals).”  Ken (88) noted a pungent fruit that definitely suggested a nut- and peach-toned dark chocolate, but found a bit less complexity than did Andy."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Co-cupper Andy Newbom (91) found much to praise (and describe) in this “complex and serious” (Andy) coffee: spice, vanilla and chocolate in the aroma, peach and grape influence in the balanced acidity, more spice and molasses together with lemon and orange zest notes in the cup. “Full and sensual” mouthfeel. Ken’s (88) notes suggest he agreed with Andy on the seriousness of this coffee but harbored some reservations about its complexity. Ken found it “crisp, quiet, intense,” with night flowers and dry berry notes in the cup and a simple though rich finish."
"El_Salvador, Santa Ana Department, El Salvador","For co-cupper Andy Newbom (88) “dried peaches and a hint of prunes struggle to open into dark chocolate” in the cup. For Ken (89) the sweet dried fruit notes actually make it to dark chocolate, albeit a “berry-toned” version. Similarly, Ken tastes the good side of the finish, citing “long, deep, dry berry notes,” whereas for Andy an attractive “dried fruit sweetness” in the finish was compromised by “hard mineral fruit notes.” Both noted a “soft citrus” [Andy] acidity and a full but slightly rough mouthfeel."
"El_Salvador, Usulutan Department, El Salvador","For Ken (90) and co-cupper Andy Newbom (88) “A classic and lovely El Salvador Bourbon with an intriguing twist at the end” (Andy). Pre-twist, Ken’s more general descriptions emphasize dry raisiny fruit, nut, and flowers, whereas Andy’s descriptors are more specific, not to mention more extravagant: “sweet dried nectarines and hibiscus” in the aroma, “flavors of stone fruits with apricot leading, hints of yellow pear and apple, a touch of soft lemonosity” in the cup, “honey … chocolate … peach” in the finish. As the cup cooled the twist at the end emerged. The hints of nut that Ken cited blossomed into a very explicit, dominating nut character with notes that Andy identified as “cashew and almond.”"
"Costa_Rica, Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica","“It’s sweet,” reports co-cupper Andy Newbom (90); Ken (90) agrees, though Ken is most impressed by the way sweetness is balanced by a deep pungency. Perhaps that’s what Andy is describing when he cites “Warm peaches and apple blossoms with hints of dark cherry” in the aroma. Lemon figures prominently in Andy’s descriptors of acidity and cup, tart berry in Ken’s. Both find suggestions of cocoa nibs, chocolate, and cassis. Andy finds “an intriguing lavender … note” in a finish that Ken describes more generally as “sweet, rich and deep.”"
"Colombia, Bucaramanga growing region, Santander Department, Colombia","Both co-cupper Andy Newbom (90) and Ken (90) emphasized the crisp acidity and balanced structure of this aromatically rather quiet coffee. “Exquisite crisp green-apple acidity with a touch of kiwi skin” and a “nicely smooth mouthfeel with a bit of a fruit leather feeling” for Andy, who found the green apple carrying into the flavor. For Ken the gently acidy tendency in the flavor suggested dry berry and lemon; both Andy and Ken noted a hint of cocoa nib, a vegetable-toned chocolate. More green apple in the finish for Andy while Ken simply describes a pleasing tart sweetness."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Co-cupper Andy Newbom (92) and Ken (91) both found ways to admire this Kenya. Andy’s descriptors circle enthusiastically around flowers and citrus; “gardenia and lemon-blossom” in the aroma, “pears – orange butter and complex mild citrus” together with “gardenia and rose” in the cup. Ken reported parallel, if more generalized, descriptors of black currant, blackberry and hints of lemon, aromatic wood and night flowers. The mouthfeel was “fat and silky” for Ken, “creamy and fruity” for Andy. Ken was slightly disappointed by what he felt was a slight astringent imbalance in the finish, which for Andy was “long … smooth and lingered romantically.”"
"El_Salvador, Chalatenango Department, El Salvador","Both Ken (93) and co-cupper Andy Newbom (92) admired the deep, profoundly fruit-toned character of this coffee. “Very sweet, richly but discreetly fruity coffee” for Ken, displaying “butter, honey, nut, aromatic wood, night flowers, a hint of herb.” Andy read more excitement and less discretion in the fruit character, in which (prepare yourself) “a menage a trois of raisins, dates and butterscotch got together with tangerine, clover honey and some lemons and raspberries and threw the sexiest block part ever.” Incidentally, sweetly bright acidity, “round and juicy” (Andy) mouthfeel, and a finish that resolved the profile with profound sweetness and “the slightest hint of savory complexity” (also Andy)."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Same admiring scores from Ken (93) and co-cupper Andy Newbom (93) for this smoothly complete, complexly balanced coffee. “Sweet fruit and spice” in the aroma for Andy, which provokes ideas of “stewed jasmine and apricots.” Ken finds flowers and apricot also, along with a little pungent note he calls butterscotch. The acidity is “smoothly delicate” for Ken, “luxurious and suave” for Andy, who suggests the acidity “combined the best of both red and golden apples.” Refined flavor with a fine balance of dry and sweet fruit tones. Andy elaborates with an avalanche of allusions to apricot, casaba melon and “touches of red currant and candied grapefruit.” Rich, deep, “long and glorious” (Andy) finish."
"Costa_Rica, Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica","Co-cupper Andy Newbom (94) admired this pungent yet lushly sweet Bourbon slightly more than Ken (92) did. Certainly Andy found more ways to describe its engaging contrast of lush sweetness and almost savory spice. For Andy “root beer, lemon peel” in the aroma, “fruit leather” in the acidity; a “complex blend of tangerine and cinnamon oil, clarified butter and sweet red pepper rounding into guava and gooseberry” in the cup, plus “hints of cocoa nib.” The finish impressively resolved the pungent/sweet paradox running through the profile: “astoundingly clear and bell-toned” for Andy; “long, sweetly flavor-saturated” for Ken."
"Hawaii, Ka'u growing district, southwestern corner of the """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","“An absolutely mind-blowing coffee” for co-cupper Andy Newbom (93). “Utterly pure yet soaringly intense,” for Ken (97). “Say fruit ten times,” Andy reports, and then he does, mainly variations of grapefruit, apricot and melon with green apple and Bartlett pear thrown in for the finish. For Ken that entire nuance is wrapped up in the extraordinary, singular explosion of cedary, pungently sweet berry, the quintessential Bourbon character. The acidity is enveloped in sweetness; in Andy’s colorful language it “startles and snuggles all at once.” For mouthfeel Andy suggests “crème fra&icirc;che Meyer lemon chiffon”; Ken sticks with a pedestrian “syrupy.” Ken awarded a perfect 10 to the long, balanced, deeply flavor-saturated finish."
"Thailand, Northern Thailand","Intriguing mid-tones throughout the profile: mainly a sort of orangy, floral citrus with a backgrounded complex simultaneously suggesting fresh earth, mushroom and decomposing leaves. All of this takes on a vaguely chocolaty tone in the finish. Gently smooth acidity, medium body."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Rich, very intense aroma: dark chocolate, aromatic wood, nut, hints of citrus: orange, tangerine. The cup is influenced by a moderately dark roast, which nicely rounds acidity and turns the celebrated Kenya dry berry notes toward a crisply sweet cocoa or dark chocolate, with a continued shimmer of citrus. The berry-toned chocolate carries into a simple, rich finish. The only limitation of this graceful coffee is a lean, almost thin mouthfeel, though that could be admired as another expression of its complex delicacy."
"Hawaii, Holualoa, North Kona growing district, Hawaii","An exciting, rather unusual complex of sweet but pungent citrus, nut and flowers animates the profile from aroma through finish. The citrus in particular is complex and engaging, one moment suggesting Meyer lemon, another especially sweet grapefruit. One cup of five we sampled displayed a very slight hint of bitterness; otherwise the rating for this exotic coffee would go higher."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Clean, complex, impeccable. Exhilaratingly dominated by crisp, nut-toned dry berry (blackberry, ripe black currant) in aroma and cup. Lush, lightly wine-toned acidity; medium body; syrupy mouthfeel. The underlying sweetness in the cup carries into the long, flavor-permeated finish."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Rich, complex fruit aroma, intensely sweet and full. Roundly balanced acidity, smooth body, with a hint of floral and fruit tones expanding in the cup: sweet citrus, berries, currants. A mildly astringent mouthfeel carries into the lightly bittersweet chocolate-toned finish."
"Rwanda, Butare, southern Rwanda","Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (88): “This coffee had a complex, well-balanced aroma that reminded me of a vanilla flower, although I?ve never smelled a vanilla flower. I wish more of this had carried over into the cup, because the flavor was not as complex [nor] as interesting.” Ken (92), on the other hand, found the floral and prune-toned fruit character of the aroma carried well into the cup, joined by cocoa and a slight, not unpleasant, salt or savory note. Ken and Jim agreed, however, in praising the richly resonant finish."
"Rwanda, Rwanda","Balanced, pungent character – “smoky and nutty” for co-cupper Jim Reynolds (89), “prune, nut, aromatic wood” for Ken (90) with rich floral hints. Smooth mouthfeel, round, rich finish."
"Burundi, Kayanza Province, Burundi","Rich, low-toned, deceptively simple coffee. Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (89) found it a quietly complete cup, though “somewhat shy” in acidity. Both Jim and Ken (90) wrestled with a very slight hint of what cuppers call “bagginess,” a faint mildewed note that appears in coffees that have suffered exposure to too much moisture during shipment or storage. The coffee’s essential richness and floral cocoa tendencies overcame this shadow note, however, allowing the underlying beauty of the coffee to resonate in cup and long, flavor-saturated finish."
"Burundi, Kayanza Province, Burundi","For co-cupper Jim Reynolds (89) a smooth and essentially complete cup but too subdued, with “unassertive acidity.” Ken (90) found the cup quiet as well, but enjoyed floral, apricot, chocolate, possibly butter notes in aroma and cup, with an acidity that was richly red-wine-like."
"Rwanda, Nyamagabe, South Province, Rwanda","Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (91) praised a “spicy pungency” in the aroma and a smooth, balanced acidity. Ken (89) agreed. Both found the pungent character carrying into the cup, complicated for Ken by hints of flowers and cocoa. Simple but satisfying finish. Jim found the body “balanced in the light to medium range” but Ken found the mouthfeel a bit lean, accounting for his somewhat lower score."
"Tanzania, Mbeya Region, southwestern Tanzania","Both co-cupper Jim Reynolds (90) and Ken (91) described a very sweet-toned aroma and pleasingly delicate acidity, which Ken glossed as “wine-toned.” Lightly syrupy mouthfeel, clean and balanced in flavor, “nutty” for Jim, tartly fruity and floral for Ken. Very sweet-finishing."
"Rwanda, Huye, South Province, Rwanda","Ken (93) favored this coffee considerably more than did co-cupper Jim Reynolds (89) despite the fact that both described it in similar terms. Ken was taken by floral qualities in aroma and cup, an essential sweetness, and what he called a complimentary “cocoaish dry fruit,” doubtless the same sensation as Jim describes positively as “pungent” and “spicy and nutty.” Both agreed that the acidity was gentle, though Ken scored it higher and described it as “crisp and sweet.” Both found the mouthfeel attractively smooth and the finish long and flavor-saturated."
"Rwanda, Huye, South Province, Rwanda","Ken (92) particularly admired this coffee’s deep, night-blossoming floral character which he felt was balanced by an underlying crisp, cedary cocoa. Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (91) found the profile “mild” and caramelly with a soft ? for Jim, a bit too soft ? acidity."
"Rwanda, Rwanda","Co-cupper Jim Reynolds and Ken both admired this coffee, but Ken, at 90, was less admiring than Jim at 95. Essentially, Jim found everything he wanted in an African coffee of this style – a combination of complexity, balance and deep dimension – whereas Ken liked what he found but wanted more of it, more intensity and a more pronounced, distinctive character. Both admired a bright, citrusy but delicate acidity, silky mouthfeel, and a mildly pungent chocolate that Jim described as “smoky chocolate” and Ken as “cocoa and aromatic wood.” Jim found the aftertaste “lingering,” Ken found it pleasing but short."
"Burundi, Kayanza Province, Burundi","Both co-cupper Jim Reynolds (94) and Ken (91) particularly admired the “active acidity” (Jim) of this coffee with its rich berry and floral influences. Jim found the flavor “complex but balanced.” Ken was more specific: “dark chocolate, cherryish fruit, a hint of dusk flowers.” Both approved of mouthfeel (“lightly syrupy,” Ken) and finish (“light, bright and very pleasant,” Jim)."
"Tanzania, Mbeya Region, southwestern Tanzania","Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (92) admired the “spicy, floral qualities” of this coffee, as did Ken (94), who found blackberry and spicy rose in both aroma and cup. A medium-bodied coffee, but both Jim and Ken remarked on the impressively smooth mouthfeel. Ken showed perhaps a bit more admiration for delicate poise of this coffee, which may account for his higher score."
"Burundi, Kayanza Province, Burundi","Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (95): “This coffee scored well in every category. I especially liked the floral acidity – a nice vanilla and chocolate aspect to the flavor complemented the smooth – very smooth – mouthfeel.” Ken’s praise (94) was nearly identical, though he added “spicy fruit” and a hint of lemon to his descriptors. Impressive flavor persistence in a long, rich finish."
"Colombia, Cauca Department, south-western Colombia","The aroma is sweet-toned and alive with flowers, ripe tomato, a hint of cedar; the mouthfeel silky. The issue in the cup is the acidity, sweet but intense, all but sidelining delicate cocoa and floral notes and carrying with dry authority into the finish."
"Indonesia, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia","Sweet-toned aromatic wood and roundly fruity aroma, with hints that suggest coconut. Medium to full body, soft mouthfeel, balanced acidity, and a complex range of flavors – grapefruit, lime, coconut, sweet table grapes, aromatic wood and a suggestion of flowers. Flavor characteristics linger and sweeten in the long, slightly dry finish."
"Ethiopia, Sidamo growing region, southern Ethiopia","A graceful floral-toned cocoa dominates. In the aroma very sweet-toned, buttery pungency, flowering grass, orangy citrus. In the cup, gentle, roast-muted acidity, silky mouthfeel, and the impressive floral-toned cocoa that persists into a rich finish."
"Rwanda, Lake Kivu Region, Rwanda","Soft aroma of flowers and flowering grass, lime-like citrus and a hint of milky chocolate. Notes of toast, sweet citrus and dry white wine in the cup, with floral hints reemerging as it cools. Balanced acidity, medium body, with a hint of astringency in the mildly fruit-toned chocolate finish."
"Brazil, Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Co-taster Byron Holcomb (92) found more going on aromatically in this poised, balanced espresso than did Ken (89). Byron: “Aroma notes of brandy, honey and walnut yielded [to] flavors of passion fruit and orange bitters. The aftertaste was ? dry with notes of bakers’ cocoa. In milk, some of the great spice notes showed: cinnamon, coriander, allspice.”"
"Yemen, Harazi growing region, north-central Yemen","Notes of fermented fruit (berry?), chocolate and aromatic wood carry from a rich, sweet-toned aroma into the cup, where they turn muted and rather heavy, though they preserve their concentrated fruit and a halo of chocolaty sweetness. Chocolate notes sustain in a long, relatively astringent finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Grandly fruity and sweetly fermented profile: port wine, raisiny dark chocolate, night flowers, blueberry, all carry with giddy intensity from aroma through cup to the long finish. Wine-like acidity, syrupy body, deep sweetness."
"India, Southern India","Deep aroma: sweet nut, hints of orange, toast and vanilla. Smooth, buttery mouthfeel and pungent flavors of cedar, more orange and caramel, toasted grains and a hint of flowers. The sweet nut tone returns in the finish. The subtle flavors found in the small cup turn subdued in milk, limited to a mild, milky chocolate and toasted nut; finishing with a fine sweetness but a hint of astringency."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea","The difference between co-cupper Jennifer Stone?s score of 84 and Ken’s 89 depended on how they responded to a shadow fault in an otherwise impressive, complex coffee. The fault emerged as the coffee cooled; Jennifer simply called it an “off” note; Ken described it as vaguely metallic though very faint. Slight fault aside, this is a classic South Pacific profile, gently pungent with aromatic wood and nut notes softened by hints of bananaish fruit and night flowers."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea","Both co-cupper Jennifer Stone (88) and Ken (90) remark on a distinct natural sweetness running from aroma through a gentle acidity to a long, resonant finish. Ken found more to remark on in regard to aromatic and flavor notes: nut and a hint of milk chocolate in the aroma, a more explicit chocolate in the cup, together with a hint of cherryish fruit. Delicate, rather lean mouthfeel."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Highlands of Papua New Guinea","Crisp, straightforward coffee; co-cupper Jennifer Stone (89) was impressed by its full mouthfeel and rather deep dimension, Ken (88) by its general balance and poise. The pleasant but muted aromatics were difficult to sort out with any precision; Jennifer tended toward caramel and chocolate; Ken was more into nut. Lest that sounds too much like sundae toppings, these were crisp, bitter-sweet, coffee-contexted nuances."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea",Co-cupper Jennifer Stone (88) remarked on this coffee?s winy acidity and pungent flavor and aromatics; Ken (89) glossed pungent with references to spicy aromatic wood and backgrounded dark chocolate. The finish stays on the rich side of astringent.
"Papua_New_Guinea, Western Highlands, Papua New Guinea","Quiet, balanced profile that holds up with particular grace as the cup cools. Co-cupper Jennifer Stone (90) remarks on the clean simplicity of the profile with perhaps a coffee romantic’s regret at a lack of aromatic intrigue; nevertheless, both Ken (91) and Jennifer found subtleties in the aromatics and flavor, with Ken reading sweet, subdued citrus and cocoa, Jennifer spicy stone fruit, and both remarking on the distinct floral notes. Softly assertive acidity, medium body, sweet finish."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea","Sweet-toned, foresty aroma; co-cupper Jennifer Stone (90) found flowering grass and herb; Ken (91) freshly cut wood and night flowers. In the cup gently bright acidity, full body with lightly syrupy mouthfeel, and continued garden-toned aromatics: flowers (both Ken and Jennifer), nut (Ken), citrus (Jennifer).

The elegantly pungent berry note cuppers call black currant dominates in the cup, but supported by a profound underlying sweetness that gives the berry a dark chocolate depth. Flowers revive in the fine, rich, flavor-saturated finish."
"El_Salvador, Ahuachapan region, El Salvador","A light-roasted coffee rather too bright and lean-bodied to fulfill conventional expectations for espresso, though shimmeringly floral and citrusy throughout the profile. “Very clean and floral in the aroma” for co-taster Heather Perry (87). In the small cup refreshingly if rather sharply citrus, with “delicate butter and floral notes” (Ken, 87) that carry into an impressive, sweetly dry finish. The delicate floral and citrus profile fades in milk, however, retaining a tart sweetness but quite lean in mouthfeel."
"Bolivia, Sud-Yungas region, Bolivia","Mouthfeel and presence trumped aromatics. Both co-taster Heather Perry (87) and Ken (87) admired smooth, lightly syrupy mouthfeel in the small cup and solid balance in milk. Aromatics were relatively subdued and simple, however: “spicy” with “light lemon undertones” for Heather, “smoky chocolate” with floral hints for Ken (87)."
"Australia, Northern Rivers region, New South Wales, Australia","Ken (88) showed more enthusiasm for the small cup than co-taster Heather Perry (87), finding the aroma simple but “high-toned and elegant,” the body leanish but smooth, the flavor pungently smoky (for Heather pleasantly tobacco notes in the aroma turned “ashy” in the cup), the finish sweet and long. Both found the presence in milk simple but “balanced and sweet” (Heather)."
"Ethiopia, Wollega (also Welega) growing region, western Ethiopia","Both Ken (89) and co-taster Heather Perry (87) admired the aroma: “creamy berry” for Heather, “bananaish fruit with floral top notes” for Ken. But for both the mouthfeel was a bit lean in the small cup and the flavor a bit sharp, though Ken admired the continued floral notes. For both tasters the profile smoothed in the long finish, with a sweet flavor persistence that suggested chocolate for Ken, “blackberry pie” for Heather. Heather found it lost sweetness in milk but Ken was pleased, finding it crisp with “true chocolate” notes."
"Guatemala, Huehuetenango growing region, Guatemala","A simple, rich, roast-influenced espresso that particularly came into its own in milk. In the small cup deep, roundly dark-chocolate-toned aroma, full body, gently pungent flavor and finish with roast-influenced notes that co-taster Heather Perry (88) associated with herbs (particularly thyme) and Ken (91) with cedar, night flowers and black cherry.

"Brazil, Coromandel growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Both Ken (90) co-taster Heather Perry (89) found this sample pleasingly and crisply fruity; “Meyer lemon” notes dominated for Heather, spicy floral and orange for Ken. Despite a tendency to express itself in floral and fruit notes, the shot maintained balance throughout and showed well in milk, with attractive hints of chocolate and (for Ken) spicy, rose-toned flowers."
"El_Salvador, Citala region, El Salvador","Both Ken (91) and co-taster Heather Perry remarked on a delicate, slightly pungent quality in both aroma and small cup that that Heather associated with herb and orange peel and Ken with cedar and orange. Medium-bodied, with a flavor-saturated finish. In milk both Heather and Ken found balance, with continued orange-toned and, for Ken, chocolaty nuance."
"Ethiopia, Harrar (or Harar) growing region, eastern Ethiopia","Flowers and tropical fruit in the sweet-toned aroma. For co-taster Heather Perry (88), “Floral notes turned to orange, berry, spice and cocoa, complex yet balanced and sweet” in the small cup. Ken (91) agreed. However, Heather found the shot in milk “very rough” whereas Ken liked it: “sweet, balanced, with a banana-toned chocolate.”"
"Brazil, Matas de Minas growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Fine straight-shot espresso. Rich in the aroma with a delicately pungent note Ken (91) called cedar and co-taster Heather Perry (90) spice. In the small cup dense and syrupy in mouthfeel with dark chocolate and continued spice and orangey cedar notes. Long, resonantly flavor-saturated finish. Loses some power and complexity, though it remains pleasantly drinkable and the orangey/spicy chocolate persists."
"Zimbabwe, Eastern Highlands, Zimbabwe","Complex, authoritative espresso. Ken (92) found dark chocolate and fresh leather notes in the aroma, co-taster Heather Perry (89) nut. Both remarked on an attractive bittersweet citrus character in the cup, which Heather nicely characterized as “blood orange.” Ken was particularly taken by the citrusy chocolate finish. But perhaps this coffee’s most remarkable performance was in milk, where the crisp fruit bloomed with round, chocolate- and berry-toned assurance."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Crisply floral-toned aroma, caramel and pear-toned fruit notes, with a hint of cedary warmth. In the cup medium body with a lightly and pleasantly syrupy mouthfeel. A bright, pronounced acidity simplifies the aromatics when the cup is hot, but as it cools a delicate, tight-knit complexity emerges: hints of white wine, caramelly milk chocolate, continued pear-toned fruit. Clean, sweetly dry finish."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Symphonically rich coffee of extraordinary elegance. Crisp dry berry notes of the kind often characterized as black currant, orange, nut, dusk flowers run through the profile from aroma to cup. Powerful acidity enveloped in sweetness, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. The black currant notes in particular carry into a long, pure, sweet-toned finish."
"Brazil, Carmo de Minas growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Sweet-toned aroma with fruit notes that Ken (88) read as banana and co-cupper Ted Stachura (88) as blackberry. In the cup fresh, delicate, with nut and continued fruit notes complicated by floral hints that Ken found just a touch grassy, a fault that for him carried into the otherwise clean, floral-toned finish."
"Brazil, Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","In the aroma cocoaish chocolate with floral top notes. In the cup Ken (89) and co-cupper Ted Stachura (87) both found continued baker’s chocolate notes with a lean toward nut. Complications for Ken were hints of flowers and white wine, for Ted faint suggestions of citrus and pipe tobacco. Round and chocolaty in the short finish, fading toward a mild astringency (Ted: “dry wood”) in the long."
"Brazil, Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Roasty notes in both aroma and cup: pungent cedar, dark chocolate, caramel. For co-cupper Ted Stachura (88) further hints of nut and pipe tobacco; for Ken (88) dusk flowers. Full body, lightly syrupy mouthfeel, a slight hint of astringency in the otherwise rich, sweet, cocoa-toned finish."
"Brazil, Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","A very sweet-toned coffee with a balancing crisp pungency. Roasted nut notes turned up in aroma and cup for both Ken (89) and co-cupper Ted Stachura (86) with low-acid fruit notes that Ken read as raisin and Ted as cherry. Ken found cocoa and dusk-floral notes in both cup and finish, which perhaps accounts for his higher rating."
"Brazil, Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Ken (89) and co-cupper Ted Stachura (88) both found cocoa, black-cherryish fruit and nut notes running from aroma through finish. Soft acidity, medium body, silky mouthfeel. Rich finish with fruit notes persisting through a very slight hint of astringency."
"Brazil, Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Caramelly, wine-like aroma with ripe, perhaps overripe, fruit notes. Dense, heavy presence in the cup.

"Brazil, Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Co-cupper Ted Stachura (91) and Ken (88) both admired the honeyish, crisply fruit- and floral-influenced aroma.

Flavor: floral, sweet, [with] notes of tangerine and fruity white wine. Mild, nutty finish.”"
"Brazil, Mogiana growing region, Sao Paulo State, south-central Brazil","Ken (91) was more attracted to this coffee’s sweet, deeply low-toned, big-bodied character than was co-cupper Ted Stachura (89), who found the dominant nut and bittersweet chocolate character marked by a hint of woodiness. But both cuppers describe a deep, dark-chocolaty, nutty coffee with a balancing hint of citrus and a rich if slightly heavy finish."
"Brazil, Coromandel growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Little difference in rating or description between Ken (92) and co-cupper Ted Stachura (91) in regard to this exceptional Brazil natural. Ted’s assessment: “Big, floral aroma – lavender, fruit and sweet-leaning white wine. Floral and fruit qualities carry into the bright, yet fine, acidity. Complex flavors with more floral upfront, subtle, tart citrus tones and lots of sweetness. Clean finish with lingering floral hints.”"
"Brazil, Carmo de Minas growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Ken (91) was struck by the pungently sweet berry or black currant notes, which carry straight through from aroma through cup to finish. Co-cupper Ted Stachura (also 91) was a bit more general in his characterization, finding “sweet, winy tones and fruit” in the aroma and “bright acidity with floral qualities and sweet tangerine, cherry blossom and chocolate” in the cup. For both Ken and Ted the finish was slightly heavy but nevertheless pleasantly rich and flavor-saturated."
"Brazil, Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","In the aroma roasted nut and honey for co-cupper Ted Stachura (91), plum, cedar and nut for Ken (92). In the cup softly acidy, gently bittersweet, quietly complex: cocoa, roasted nut, (walnut for Ted), hints of flowers, citrus and plumy fruit. The cocoa turns chocolaty in a surprisingly rich finish."
"Brazil, Carmo de Minas growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Balanced, complex, complete. The quiet but assertive acidity was praised as “balanced” by co-cupper Ted Stachura (93) and “sweet, rich, integrated” by Ken (94). The mouthfeel was “juicy” (Ted), the aroma and cup showed a crisply sweet complex of dry berry, cocoa, flowers, citrus, nut. Long, deep, chocolate-toned finish."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Exquisitely lyric aroma: flowers, tart cherry, honey, a suggestion of milk chocolate. In the cup sweet acidity and continued meadowy flower and flowering grass notes, honey, tart cherry, all of which carry into a delicate but ringing finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Exhilarating, fresh-toned aroma: jasmine, sweet herbs. In the cup crisply sweet-toned acidity, medium body, continued flowers, sweet herb and a tingly, cocoa-toned chocolate. Deep, flower-saturated finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","A quiet but distinctive Ethiopia wet-processed profile.

The cup stiffens and simplifies slightly as it cools."
"Costa_Rica, Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica",Blind Assessment:
"Rwanda, Rwanda","A paradoxical coffee, thin and subdued, but with considerable suggestions of richness and complexity. In the aroma muted suggestions of night flowers, butter, black cherries. In the cup lean but silky mouthfeel and delicate hints of spicy nut, cocoa, more flowers and cherry, perhaps of a rather dullish aromatic wood. The flavor persists nicely into an otherwise short, fast-fading finish."
"Brazil, Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Crisp, cocoaish dark chocolate with nut and floral hints in the aroma. Soft, muted acidity in the cup, medium body, with a very sweet, molasses-toned character balanced by the walnut-like crispness of the pervasive cocoa notes. Continued hints of flowers. Short but nicely flavor saturated finish."
"Yemen, North-central Yemen, wet of the capital city of Sana'a","Janus-like coffee: sweet, rich, and lushly fruity with an herby bitter note that, depending on taste, either complicates or shadows the main event of the fruit. In the aroma the lushly fermented fruit reads as rich, cherryish chocolate with a hint of flowers and pungent cedar. In the cup gently acidy, medium bodied, crisply sweet with continued cherry- and chocolate-toned fruit and the bitterish rosemary note. Sweetness and chocolate prevail in the surprisingly clean finish."
"Colombia, Cauca Department, southern Colombia","Explosive aromatics: In the break deep, rich, buttery and honey-like with suggestions of flowers, coffee fruit, fresh-tanned leather. In the cup the butter notes turn rather pungent, toward butterscotch with continued flowers and a fruit that softens toward milk chocolate. Medium bodied, slightly underpowered and short in the finish but intense and intriguing aromatics throughout."
"Bolivia, Caranavi growing region, Bolivia","Intense, crisp yet sweet-toned aroma with honey, cedar and rose notes. In the cup soft acidity, medium body, and a lyric, delicate complexity: honey, sweet cherry, molasses, cedar, hints of milk chocolate and flowering grass. Clean, elegant, though rather short finish."
"Colombia, Colombia","Nut, honeyed flowers and tart cherry dominate the aroma. In the cup the acidity is intense but rounded, the mouthfeel syrupy, the structure sweet, the aromatics deep: the flowers turn softly pungent and spicy, the fruit richer and more complex. In the finish the honeyed sweetness envelops a slight astringency."
"Guatemala, Huehuetenango growing region, Guatemala","High-toned, simple, classic aroma: orange, sweet tomato, hints of cedar and milk chocolate.

Long, tartly sweet finish."

"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","This coffee declares its essential Yirgacheffe character immediately: perfumy and pungently menthol-toned in the aroma, shimmering with floral and lemon notes. The aromatic drama carries without loss or simplification into a gently bright cup, light-bodied but silky in mouthfeel. The finish is thinnish but long, sweet, and flower-saturated."
"Colombia, Southern Colombia","Impressive aroma: crisp but smooth, rich, with butter, lavender, dark chocolate notes, a hint of toast.

Stays just on the rich side of astringent in the sweet-toned finish."
"Costa_Rica, Costa Rica","A sweet-toned, gently acidy, lyric medium-roasted coffee struggling with the dampening impact of decaffeination. Orange, white wine, and temperate fruit notes, pear perhaps, almost succeed in soaring over a decaf woodiness."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","A slight menthol-like astringency throughout the profile is the only restraint to this otherwise exceptional, complexly engaging coffee. In the aroma sweet-toned and balanced with pungent orange and butterscotch notes and hints of flowers and nut. The acidity is gentle and integrated, the cup very sweet but crisp in structure, with continued orange, nut, flower and very distinct cocoa or baker’s chocolate notes.

"Colombia, Valle de Cauca Department, western Colombia","Sweet-toned, crisply rich aroma with chocolate, cedar, flowers, ripe tomato notes. In the cup powerfully but sweetly acidy, with continued flowers, cocoaish chocolate, tart cherry notes and a pungent hint of cedar. Rich, sweet, chocolate-toned finish; very slight astringency in the long."
"Colombia, Narino Department, southern Colombia","Distinctive aromatics: sweetly dry fruit notes that suggest black current, blackberry, tart cherry, cedary orange. Lightly syrupy mouthfeel, fine balance. Long, deep finish that stays on the rich side of astringent."
"Colombia, Huila Department, Colombia","Delicate but intense aroma, with milk chocolate, nut and coffee fruit notes that read as tart cherry. In the cup impressive balance and structure: lushly sweet but crisply acidy with a lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Continued tart cherry and chocolate notes carry into a simple but cleanly rich finish."
"Colombia, Huila Department, Colombia","Richly sweet-toned aroma: orange, cocoa, butterscotch. In the cup big, simple, authoritative but ingratiating, with round, ringing acidity and the pure expression of coffee fruit, a tart cherry sensation. Clean, deep, cherryish finish."
"Colombia, Valle de Cauca Department, western Colombia","Sweet-toned, quiet aroma with nut, dried cherry and chocolate. Elegantly balanced cup: softly acidy, silky in mouthfeel, with continued dried cherry, cocoaish chocolate and a slight brightening hint of lemon. The chocolate notes in particular carry into the long, rich, complex finish."
"Colombia, Tolima Department, east-central Colombia","Intense, balanced aroma: cedar, cherry, flowers, orange. In the cup syrupy body with an almost bouillon-like richness, deeply but quietly acidy, with floral high notes and a wonderfully deep cherry- and cedar-toned chocolate. The pungent chocolate/fruit notes carry into a long, flavor-saturated finish."
"Colombia, Fondo Paez Cooperative, Valle de Cauca Department, western Colombia","Sweet-toned, delicately complex aroma: flowers, hints of honey, cedar and tart cherry, perhaps chocolate. In the cup very gently acidy, light in body but buoyant and silky in mouthfeel, and giddily floral- and honey-toned with complicating hints of chocolate, tart coffee fruit and Riesling-like white wine. Fades rather quickly in the finish but exquisitely clean with memories of chocolate and flowers. An exceptionally pure and balanced coffee."
"Costa_Rica, Puntarenas Province, southeastern Costa Rica","Exquisitely clean coffee at a sensitive light roast. Delicate in structure and mouthfeel, gently and sweetly acidy, with flowering grass and molasses notes and hints of nut and milk chocolate in aroma and cup."
"Indonesia, Lintong growing region, North Sumatra Province, Indonesia","Rich, gently pungent aroma with butter, floral and apricot-toned fruit hints. In the small cup medium body, syrupy mouthfeel, and rather sharply but sweetly cedary with continued apricot and flowers and an explicit moist, leaves earth note. At its best in milk: rich, strong-presenced but sweet with dark chocolate and sustained suggestions of moist earth and flowers."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Deep-toned aroma with great range and complexity: flowers, orange, cocoa, butter, cedar. In the cup richly acidy, medium in body, silky in mouthfeel, with continued lavender-like floral notes, crisp cocoa, dry berry. Clean, tartly juicy finish with flower notes present to the last fading."
"Colombia, Colombia","Low in acidity, with a sweet, mildly fermented fruit that struck me as a bit too cloyingly sweet (banana-ish fruit, cut flowers past their prime) in the aroma, but cleaner and more attractive in the cup (banana, slightly fresher flowers, syrupy mouthfeel) and especially in a rich, fruity, if mildly astringent finish."
"Indonesia, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia","Intense, roundly balanced aroma with mildly pungent roast character and orange, nut and cedary chocolate notes. In the cup low in acidity, medium in body and agreeable but rather simple aromatically: bittersweet, woody, with only a hint of cedary, perhaps earthy, chocolate. Not a long finish, but sweet and rich."
"Brazil, Brazil","Simple, rather shallow aroma but agreeably chocolate- and nut-toned. In the cup low in acidity, syrupy in mouthfeel, sweet-toned with continued nut and crisply cocoaish chocolate notes. In the finish fades rather quickly but on the way out remains cocoaish and rich."
"Tanzania, Mt. Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania","A low-key but still distinctive cup: crisp, lean-bodied, with sweet blackberry, dry blackcurrant and pungently orange, nut and cedar notes. If it were not for a flavor-dampening undercurrent of wood this would be a 90-point coffee."
"Brazil, Brazil","Sweet, crisp, simple with walnut and minty dark chocolate notes in the aroma that consolidate as a distinct, pleasing cocoa in the quietly balanced cup. The long, rich, cocoa-toned finish is particularly impressive."
"Indonesia, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia","In the aroma sweet, intense: molasses, dry berry, butter, earth. In the cup gently acidy, delicate but – again – intense, with continued molasses and cocoa-toned earth notes. A coffee both wild and elegant. Slight heaviness in the finish and slightly uneven cups."
"Jamaica, Blue Mountain growing region, eastern Jamaica","Aromatically a rather simple coffee, but an attractive one. Deep aroma dominated by a cherryish milk chocolate with hints of cedar and banana. Sweet-toned, roundly balanced cup with quiet acidity, fullish body and continued cherry-toned chocolate carrying into a plain but long finish."
"Costa_Rica, Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica","Delicately but richly nuanced throughout the profile with cherryish fruit, flowers, honey, milk chocolate. In the cup the acidity is tart but luxuriously sweet and the mouthfeel lightly syrupy. Flavor saturated and flawless finish."
"El_Salvador, El Salvador","Pure, finely articulated coffee with notes of coffee fruit (tart cherry), orange and a crisp, minty, distinct but uncandylike chocolate. The chocolate note carries into a finish that remains on the delicately rich side of astringent."
"Rwanda, Rwanda","A deep, roundly low-toned coffee with pleasingly deep, round, low-toned aroma with distinct lemony (perhaps orangy) chocolate notes. In the cup smooth, balanced acidity, silky mouthfeel, and tart cherry and continued lemon-toned chocolate notes. A note that could be called banana appears toward the long, flavor-saturated, very slightly astringent finish."
"El_Salvador, Chalatenango Department, El Salvador",Sweet- and low-toned aroma with orangy fruit and cedar and nut notes. In the cup very well-structured with a rich slightly wine-toned acidity and silky mouthfeel but rather simple aromatically: a genial but limited orange- and cherry-toned fruit. A floral hint surfaced in the otherwise simple finish.
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Impressively intense, sweetly pungent aroma: flowers, chocolate, hints of butter and fresh-cut cedar. Rich, round, smooth-bodied and syrupy in the cup, with pleasing but limited aromatics: dusk flowers and hints of chocolate and dry berry that fade in the rich but simple finish."
"Indonesia, Sumatra, Indonesia","Evaluated as espresso. As a drip coffee fell quite short of 80. As espresso revealed some virtues. In the aroma sweet-toned with distinct chocolate and butter notes. In the small cup medium bodied, round-toned and sweet, with earth, aromatic wood and herbal notes (I read fennel) and hints of nut and chocolate. The finish was simple in the short and mildly astringent in the long. Surprisingly disappointing in milk: leanish in mouthfeel with banana and chocolate in front but a slight though disturbing note toward the finish that for me suggested salted meat."
"Indonesia, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia","A classic Sumatra balance of sweet fruit and rich earth notes animate aroma and cup. The fruit displays a distinct black-cherry and orange character, particularly in the aroma, though flavor fades rather quickly in the very mildly astringent finish."
"Kenya, Kiambu growing region, south-central Kenya","Crisp, intense, yet sweetly lyric coffee. In both aroma and cup blackcurrant, blackberry, orange, cherry; in the cup hints of cocoaish chocolate and merlot-like red wine as well. Long, sweet finish just on the rich side of astringent."
"Puerto_Rico, Adjuntas region, west-cental Puerto Rico","Sweet-toned, delicate aroma: distinct flowers (lilac?) orange, hints of honey and muted cedar. In the cup soft, sweet acidity, flowering grass, cocoa, orange. A slight grassy astringency in the finish suggests that at the time we cupped this coffee it was a bit too young. It may improve in the months following this review."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Sweet-toned, quietly intense aroma: jasmine, sweet citrus, cocoa. In the cup the mouthfeel is silky, almost syrupy, the acidity intense but delicate with shimmers of white wine. Orange, lemon, cocoaish chocolate, floral notes. Long, deep, flavor-saturated finish."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Intense, exuberantly complex aroma: orange, grapefruit, honey, cedar, blackcurrant. In the cup the acidity is intense and sweet, the mouthfeel syrupy, the flavor continuingly complex, dry yet lush: blackcurrant, grapefruit, wine, a hint of milk chocolate. The finish is superb: saturated with grapefruit and chocolate, sweet, rich, long."
"El_Salvador, Western El Salvador","A very light-roasted, naturally sweet coffee that stays just on the rich side of raw. Low-toned but intense aroma: nut notes (raw cashew?) with hints of flowers and butter. In the cup soft acidity with a shimmer of wine, substantial body, continued sweet raw nut notes with hints of butter, chocolate and flowers. Rich, long, slightly heavy finish."
"Yemen, Central north Yemen, probably near Sana'a","Ambiguous flavors associated with fruity mustiness run through the profile. Co-cupper Miguel Meza (87) describes them as: “Sweet-smoky and medicinal. A pungent and musty full-bodied coffee with exotic hints of eucalyptus, sassafras and bakers’ yeast.”  Ken (86) is more conventional and more positive: “Rich, raisiny dark chocolate with a pungent cedar and herbal edge in aroma and rather syrupy cup.”"
"Ethiopia, Ethiopia","Both co-cupper Miguel Meza (88) and Ken (89) agreed that this coffee was low-toned, but for Ken it displayed a quietly resonant depth whereas apparently for Miguel it was simply quiet. Miguel found chocolate and citrus in the aroma, Ken chocolate and a distinct ginger note. Miguel read “blueberry, over-ripe fruit and toast” in the crisply fruity cup, Ken dry chocolate, brandy, blueberries, apricot, flowers. Both noted a persistence of berryish fruit in an otherwise rather thinnish finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Co-cupper Miguel Meza’s (88) description is succinct: “Cherry liqueur, smoke and chocolate.” Ken (90) finds a similar palette: dark raisin-toned chocolate, red wine, cherry, flowers. Ken interprets Miguel’s smoke notes as a slight hint of complicating mustiness. Altogether a quiet, wood-panels and leather easy chair sort of coffee."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Co-cupper Miguel Meza (89) was rather faint in his praise of this coffee, finding a “floral and tropical citrus” character he associates with the more familiar washed or wet-processed Ethiopia profile, with added “chocolate and berry” nuance derived from dry-processing. Ken (91) wrestles with the detail a bit more, admiring a wine or brandy nuance to the chocolate and berry character, which he finds “lush but crisp.”"
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Co-cupper Miguel Meza and Ken took different descriptive paths in an attempt to characterize the underlying structure of this low-toned, full-bodied coffee. For Miguel (92) the cup was “soft and comforting” with a mix of “dried fruit and mesquite” and “berries and chocolate.” Ken (89) felt the cup’s sweet yet salty structure dominated the berry- and cocoa-toned aromatics, making the cup attractive but limited."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Co-cupper Miguel Meza (91) calls this coffee “juicy and refreshing,” Ken (91) “sweet and deep.” Both were impressed by a crisp, complex aroma (for Miguel “lemon-lime, cantaloupe and peach”) and as the cup cooled distinct cocoa and sweet ferment notes that Ken read as “brandied cherry” and Miguel (with more ambition to precision) as “distilled agave.”"
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","A soft cup, rather simple aromatically but “well-balanced” (co-cupper Miguel Meza, 91) and “smooth and deep in structure” (Ken, 91). Miguel finds “berries, citrus and chocolate,” Ken reads some quiet chocolate and perhaps some orange. The finish is quiet but impressive with continued chocolate and fruit (Miguel: strawberry and cherry) notes. (Previously reviewed and rated 92 ponts in June 2007)."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Intense, complex aroma. Quite tropical for co-cupper Miguel Meza (92) who cites guava, pineapple, and orange; Ken’s (92) associations are more temperate: blueberry, cherry, orange, honey. In the cup both Ken and Miguel find cherry and chocolate, and most likely Miguel’s “mango and caramel” and Ken’s “candyish butterscotch” both are efforts to find descriptors for the same sensation, a pleasingly pungent sweetness. Miguel passes on the finish; Ken finds the usual flaw haunting this style of coffee: a slight salty astringency hiding amid the lovely fading trajectory of fruit."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Miguel Meza (94) found only purity and ripeness in this opulent coffee; Ken (92) was impressed as well but felt just slightly let down by a limiting simplicity once past the aroma. Miguel Meza: “Vibrant, pure and ripe … Creamy mouthfeel with vanilla-like floral notes. Full and balanced with a juicy acidity that hints of peach, orange and berries in the long, clean finish.” Ken (92) admired the ripe, lush aroma every bit as much as Miguel for its “true dark chocolate, mint, floral and berry” notes, but observed that once past the aroma the cup simplified despite remaining “rich and berry-toned.” Miguel and Ken diverged most strongly over the finish, where Ken detected a shadow astringency amid the memories of aromatic complexity where Miguel found only clean flavor."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Miguel Meza (93): “An intense but slightly flawed cup. The coffee is so luscious and passionate[, however,] that such misgivings are easily forgotten. A dizzying array of ripe and dried berry flavors mingles with banana, lime and chocolate.” Ken (93) agrees, finding a rich mix of “brandyish cherry, crisp cocoa/chocolate and ripe orange” notes. He is more specific about the flaw, which for him is a slight salty astringency that “softens as the cup cools, allowing the ripe fruit notes to fully bloom.”"
"Ethiopia, Southwestern Ethiopia","Co-cupper Miguel Meza (94): “Intensely fragrant: strawberry, kiwi, cherry, amaretto. The cup is powerful, well-structured and dynamic, [progressively revealing] a whole universe of fruit flavor. Only a lingering sharp astringency, perhaps a side effect of he same process that developed the incredible range of flavors …, limits this coffee from near perfection.” Ken (92) found the lavish aroma and rich acidity particularly impressive, but like Miguel he found a slight nagging astringency in the finish, a shadow to this coffee’s monumental yet seductive aromatics."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Co-cupper Miguel Meza (92) finds bergamot and flowers in the aroma, Ken (94) finds flowers as well as cherries, red wine, and hints of chocolate and butter. In a cup that is “sweet” for Miguel, “rich and opulent” for Ken, both read cherries and blueberry and a positive fruit ferment note which Miguel nicely describes as ‘Grand Marnier” and Ken more prosaically as red wine. In either case a slight, pleasing (more so to Ken?) hint of ferment complicates a round, deep, lavishly fruity cup."
"Honduras, Honduras","Straightforward, lucid, classic. Very sweet-toned aroma with fresh coffee fruit (tart cherry) and honey notes, hints of cedar and lemon. In the cup the honeyish sweetness envelops an intense though not sharp acidity. Continued coffee fruit notes with a lemony lean. Richly tart finish."
"Indonesia, Lintong growing district of the Lake Toba region, North Sumatra Province, Sumatra, Indonesia","In the aroma deep-toned with moist earth and fruit tones that suggest molassy fruitcake or banana bread or a fruity dark chocolate. The candied fruit, molasses and moist earth complex carries into the cup, riding richly over a slight flatness introduced by decaffeination. Sweet, long, rich finish, very slightly astringent when hot but impressively smooth as the cup cools."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","The aroma is very deep and sweet-toned with lush references to banana, coconut, dusk flowers. In the cup the acidity is extraordinarily rich and round-toned, the mouthfeel supple, the nuance opulent with coconut, red wine, chocolate and floral notes. Rich, long, flavor-saturated finish."
"Indonesia, Lake Tawar basin, Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia","Intense, sweetly tart aroma: flowers, cherry, lemon. In the cup the acidity is lyrically sweet, the mouthfeel silky, the flavor vivid with grapefruit, dry berry and floral notes that soften toward a raisiny chocolate as the cup cools. Superb finish: cleanly bright, long, sweet to the far end of sensation."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Deep, pungent aroma: cedar, orange, molasses, honey. In the cup sweetly and crisply acidy, with dry berry, continued citrus and honey notes and an underlying pungent richness that suggests moist pipe tobacco. Flavor-saturated short finish; a slight astringency in the long softens as the cup cools."
"Indonesia, Lake Tawar basin, Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia","Deep, roast-influenced aroma: gently scorched cedar, cardamom, orange. In the cup the softly pungent roast and earth tones turn toward a raisiny dark chocolate, with continued distinct orange references. The finish is round, resonant, and stays well on the rich side of a slight astringency."
"Jamaica, Blue Mountain growing region, eastern Jamaica","In the aroma crisp walnut, fresh-cup wood, cardamom. In the cup syrupy body, distinct smoky and earthy notes with an underlying sweet candyish character: The whole package could be read as a sort of woodsy butterscotch. Sweet-toned finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Deep, roundly pungent fruit in the aroma: orange, semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup full-bodied, soft in acidity, and very rich, dominated by a continuing crisp semi-sweet chocolate. Simple but opulent finish."
"Colombia, Huila Department, Colombia","Deep, lush aroma: cherry, semi-sweet chocolate, flowers. In the cup smooth acidity, supple mouthfeel, sweet- and low-toned fruit and floral character suggesting semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, pipe tobacco. Simplifies a bit in the finish, particularly as the cup cools."
"Nicaragua, Nueva Segovia growing region, Nicaragua","As roasted here, a coffee most impressive for its big body and balanced structure. Deep, sweet aroma with honey and cherry notes and hints of cedar and chocolate. Sweet in the cup with quiet acidity, syrupy body, floral-toned honey and a hint of chocolate. Round, rich, simple finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Very deep-toned, naturally sweet coffee. Chocolate- and cedar-toned fruit in the aroma. In the cup softly and richly acidy, syrupy in mouthfeel, with low-toned fruit that suggests chocolate, cherry, raisin. A hint of flowers as the cup cools. Round, sweet finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Rather simple aromatically, but sweet-toned, balanced and rich. In the aroma butter, cedar and a hint of white wine. In the cup gentle, deep acidity, round mouthfeel, continued cedar and white wine notes with a hint of flowers."
"El_Salvador, Chalatenango Department, El Salvador","A very sweet coffee with a richly pungent, roast-influenced fruit character that defies easy association: for me it suggests lushly pungent pineapple; others might call it black currant or dried berry. Deep, roast-rounded acidity, lush mouthfeel, long, rich finish."
"Nicaragua, Nueva Segovia growing region, Nicaragua","Very sweet-toned, lavishly floral aroma, with tart coffee fruit and a hint of cedary chocolate. In the cup silky body and the pure flavor of ripe coffee fruit, lush yet crisp, with continued chocolate nuance and perhaps molasses or moist pipe tobacco. The finish reveals a hint of astringency when the cup is hot, but only a cherryish sweetness as it cools."
"Guatemala, Sacatepequez region, Guatemala","Quiet, shifting complexity in the aroma: orange, cedar, a hint of cinnamon. In the cup lucid, balanced, delicate: gentle acidity, silky mouthfeel, butter and continued orange notes; the cedar/cinnamon hints lean toward chocolate. Hints of flowers in the long, impressively flavor-saturated finish."
"Guatemala, Sacatepequez region, Guatemala","A quiet, very soft coffee with delicate but lush aromatics. In the nose distinct flowers, lemon, butter. The cup displays a gently bright acidity, silky, buttery mouthfeel, and a finely balanced bouquet of coffee fruit, cocoa and lemon. The cocoa softens toward chocolate in the long finish."
"El_Salvador, Chalatenango Department, El Salvador","The aroma has great depth and range of sensation: flowers, butter, cherry, hints of chocolate and cedar. In the cup rich acidity, supple mouthfeel. The aromatics simplify slightly in the mouth but retain great depth and power: tartly pungent though ripe cherry, distinct honey, a continuing hint of chocolate. Clean, sweet finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Lush, deeply fruity aroma: chocolate and red-wine-toned cherry. In the cup silky mouthfeel, richly balanced acidity, lavish cocoa, candied lemon, red wine, brandied cherry notes. Deep, flavor-saturated finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","High-toned, intense aroma with striking lemon, chocolate and menthol notes and a hint of flowers. In the cup softly and sweetly acidy with a lovely balance and distinct bittersweet chocolate and lemon notes. Superb finish: rich, crisp, saturated with a dry chocolate."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Gently and sweetly pungent aroma: butter, cedar, orange, hints of flowers and chocolate. In the cup rich red-wine-toned acidity, silky mouthfeel, deep and balanced structure with a cherryish fruit and a continued hint of chocolate. Simple, rich, sweet finish."
"Ethiopia, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","In the aroma deep, sweet, with exhilarating floral top notes and a fruit ferment that reads persuasively as raisiny chocolate with a hint of cedar. In the full-bodied cup the dark, raisin-toned chocolate and the floral notes sustain, while the pungent tendencies in the aroma intensify, contributing a cedary, herby, rather salty character to the profile. The fine aromatics regain the upper hand in the floral- and chocolate-toned finish."
"Guatemala, Huehuetenango growing region, Guatemala","Deep, sweet-toned aroma with cedar and muted hints of flowers, orange and semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup softly acidy, rather full-bodied, with continued hints of flowers and orange- and peach-toned fruit. Rich finish."
"Brazil, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","A slight musty fruit ferment serendipitously complicates this richly low-key coffee, reading as cocoa and cedar-toned ripe orange in both aroma and cup. A very slight astringency smoothes out in the long, sweet finish."
"Nicaragua, San Juan del Rio Coco, northern Nicaragua","A balanced, quietly complete cup. Simple but harmonious aroma: chocolate-toned with a hint of cedar. In the cup gently rich acidity, smooth mouthfeel, muted night flowers, milk chocolate, tart cherry. Resonant finish."
"Indonesia, Northern Sumatra, probably Aceh Province, Indonesia","In the aroma deeply pungent with a sweet earthy mustiness that suggests grapefruit with additional hints of honey and chocolate. In the cup full body with pleasantly rough mouthfeel and continued earthy notes that read as chocolate, honey and pungent citrus. Rich finish with a slight clinging astringency."
"Rwanda, Rwanda","Very sweet-toned aroma with distinct floral and fresh coffee fruit notes. In the cup sustains its sweetness with a delicate intensity and continued floral and fresh coffee fruit (tart cherry) notes that carry into a long, richly bright finish."
"Rwanda, Rwanda","Intense, floral-toned aroma with pungent suggestions of prune and cedary chocolate. In the cup very smoothly balanced, with soft acidity, silky mouthfeel and a richly dry, distinct cocoa that sustains its presence in the long finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","A lucidly pure, deeply sweet coffee. In aroma and cup lavish floral notes and gently tart coffee fruit complicate molasses and honey tones that sail with gentle voluptuousness into a long finish."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","In the aroma pungent black cherry and berry notes with lush undercurrents of orange and honey. The cedary berry notes carry richly into the cup with a continued sweet envelopment of orange and honey. Deep, long finish."
"Rwanda, Rwanda","Intense, high-toned aroma: flowers, butterscotch, orange. In the cup wine-like acidity, deep body and a continued buttery, honeyed, giddily floral character complicated by tart cherry, orange and pipe tobacco notes. Long, rich, flavor-saturated finish."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Floral-toned, intense aroma dominated by the elegantly crisp, dry berry note coffee tasters are fond of calling black currant. In the cup richly acidy. The black currant note softens toward cherry under the influence of a sweet, deeply honeyed richness. The black currant revives in the flavor-saturated finish."
"Brazil, Cerrado growing region, Minas Gerais State, Brazil","In the aroma crisp orange with hints of honey and cedar. In the small cup silky body with a continuing distinct orange note. The honey deepens toward a molasses-toned semi-sweet chocolate. Rich, chocolaty finish. In milk the orange notes complicate a delicate milk chocolate and a superb finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","High-toned and sweet aroma, lemon, flowers and menthol with an underlying hint of gently pungent cocoa. Bright and light-bodied in the cup, with continued giddily floral and lemon-toned top notes dominating crisp cocoa mid-tones. Settles into a smoothly rich finish with the quiet cocoa notes finally prevailing."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","In the aroma delicate but deep, floral, with Riesling-like wine tones and a hint of honey. In the cup surprisingly full in body, with a delicately syrupy mouthfeel and a deeply lush, floral-saturated honey character with a hint of dry berry. Rich finish with good flavor persistence. Slightly astringent, but the sweetness lingers to the far edge of possibility."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Sweet-toned aroma dominated by a distinct honey character. In the cup syrupy mouthfeel, giddily and complexly lush with cherryish fruit, floral, and dry, brandyish chocolate notes. The finish is deep, honeyish sweet, and long."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Tart but lushly sweet aroma: Floral-saturated cherryish fruit and a cedary milk chocolate. In the cup the acidity is big, round, and deeply sweet, the general structure dry but opulent with a basket of berry/cherry notes, honey, flowers, chocolate. Rich, resonant finish with impressive flavor persistence."
"Costa_Rica, Tres Rios growing region, central Costa Rica","A soft, balanced, gently lively coffee. In the aroma orange, flowers and a cedary chocolate. In the cup medium body with silky mouthfeel and quiet but distinct floral and orange notes, perhaps with some molasses-toned hints suggesting moist pipe tobacco. Sweet, clean, floral-toned finish."
"Hawaii, Ka'u growing district, southwestern corner of the """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","Lush, deep aroma with floral, honey and milk chocolate notes. In the cup gentle but intense acidity, syrupy mouthfeel, and a voluptuous floral and honey character deriving ultimately from the flavor of pure, ripe coffee fruit. Simple but long, honeyed finish."
"Brazil, Sul de Minas growing region, southern Minas Gerais State, Brazil","Very sweet-toned aroma with hints of honey, lemon, flowers and a slight cedary pungency. In the cup the acidity is quietly soft but wine-like, the mouthfeel silky, the flavor dominated by a continued honeyed sweetness and a balancing cocoa and walnut crispness."
"Latin_America, Latin America","In the aroma crisp, deep, cherryish fruit and fresh-cut cedar. In the cup leanish mouthfeel with a continued crisply roasty character, slight smoky edge and an undercurrent of ripe fruit. The finish is simple but round and rich."
"El_Salvador, El Salvador","Deep aroma with chocolate- and raisin-toned fruit. In the cup good body with a slightly rough mouthfeel and continued heavy, sweet fruit notes suggesting cocoa and raisin. Simple but rich finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing district, southern Ethiopia","Intense aroma: nut, mint, brandied cherry chocolate. In the cup rich acidity, silky body and a continuing aromatic profile so deeply and explosively complex that a world of coffee sensation can be found in it: cocoaish chocolate, raisin, flowers, lemon, brandy, orange peel. Very sweet and flavor-saturated short finish, though in the long a very slight salty astringency shadows the fine aromatic echoes."
"Indonesia, Lintong growing district of the Lake Toba region, North Sumatra Province, Sumatra, Indonesia","A superb example of its type, though not a coffee for the conventional. Wood and musty earth notes in the aroma are enriched by butter and orange that together read persuasively as a sort of butterscotch. Rather lean-bodied but very sweet in the cup with orange, pipe tobacco and continued butterscotch notes. In the finish suddenly blossoms and soars, with altogether new and surprising chocolate and even some giddy floral notes."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Waghi Valley, Western Highlands, Papua New Guinea","Lushly complex aroma: flowers, honey, molasses and sweetly tart fruit notes that suggest grapefruit. In the cup moderate in acidity, medium in body, with an opulent candyish, molasses-toned floral character and continued tart fruit notes enriched by a slight, brandy-like ferment. Clean, rich finish. The cup flattens very slightly as it cools."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing district, southern Ethiopia","No hints here: The aromatics are direct, inescapable, lavish. Lushly intense blueberry, chocolate, and floral-toned honey in the aroma. In the cup the incendiary aromatics are influenced by a wine-like acidity that turns the berry and chocolate notes crisp and richly dry. The fundamental berry and floral notes linger with surprising clarity in the finish, although they are outlasted by a slight but forgivable astringency."
"Puerto_Rico, Yauco growing region, central Puerto Rico","Opens well: Very sweet-toned, deep aroma with a hint of mustiness that merely complicates a tight-knit, delicate complexity: cedar, semi-sweet chocolate, dry berry, orange. In the cup remains sweet, but the musty character dominates, narrowing the aromatics toward a sort of rough, cedary chocolate. Rather tight, salty finish."
"Jamaica, Central Jamaica","Sweet-toned, delicately rich aroma: hints of flowers, milk chocolate, orange, molasses. In the cup the mouthfeel is lean to the point of watery, with aromatics so delicate they almost don’t register: orange, molasses, pipe tobacco, and nut-like notes that hint at chocolate. Impressively clean, sweet finish."
"Haiti, Haiti","Soft aroma, with floral top notes, and prune- or apricot-toned fruit and a hint of chocolate. Simplifies in the cup, turning gently bittersweet. The deep-toned, prune-like fruit grows more pungent, the chocolate hints drier. Smoothes out again in the impressively sweet, finish."
"Jamaica, Blue Mountain growing region, eastern Jamaica","Crisp, rather limited aroma: caramel and milk chocolate. In the cup sweet, delicate, rather shallow and lean, with a pleasant dry nutty chocolate character. Unexpectedly, the finish stretches out splendidly, rich and chocolate-toned."
"Jamaica, Jamaica, other unspecified origins","Sweet-toned, deep aroma with distinct orange notes and hints of nut and semi-sweet chocolate. The cup is dominated by a plush orange- and wine-toned acidity, sweet and richly balanced, with continued hints of dry chocolate that carry into a richly astringent finish."
"Jamaica, Blue Mountain growing region, eastern Jamaica","Very sweet-toned, very deeply dimensioned aroma, with lush cedary chocolate notes and hints of banana and molasses. In the cup plush in mouthfeel, roundly resonant, chocolate-toned. Rich but simple finish."
"Jamaica, Blue Mountain growing region, eastern Jamaica","Sweet-toned, soft, very delicate aroma with orange, floral and pungently buttery (butterscotch?) notes. In the cup light to medium bodied but silky in mouthfeel, with a gently bittersweet character and crisp chocolate and orange peel notes. As the cup cools an attractive mint-like note also emerges. The chocolate and orange notes linger impressively in the long, clean finish."
"Costa_Rica, Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica","Pure, balanced, quietly complete. Sweet-toned, deep aroma with rounded fruit notes, butter, milk chocolate, a hint of flowers and lemon. In the cup rich acidity, silky mouthfeel and continued understated milk chocolate, butter and tart-cherry coffee-fruit notes. Sweet, consistent finish."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","In the aroma delicately complex: berries, flowers, sweet lemon, honey. In the cup opulent: syrupy mouthfeel, sweet acidity, crisply powerful berry notes, continued hints of honey and flowers. Only a rich but simple finish prevents this coffee from rating in the high 90s."
"Guatemala, Antigua valley, Guatemala","A grandly classic coffee, very sweet and deep in the aroma, with berry- and cherry-toned fruit and a balancing hint of crisp lemon and cedar. The cup is dominated by a full, lush acidity: gently tart yet almost sugary sweet. The dry berry and cherry notes persist in the rich finish."
"Ethiopia, Southern Ethiopia","Lushly sweet cherry-brandy and chocolate-toned aroma with hints of cedar and banana. Continued hints of buttery-textured tropical fruit in the cup supporting continued rich, grapey brandy and cherryish chocolate notes that turn toward blueberry as the cup cools. The complex fruit persists in the finish, though shadowed by a slight salty astringency."
"Costa_Rica, Costa Rica","In the aroma sweet-toned, deeply but gently roasty, with unusual lemon-floral character and background hints of chocolate and smooth, banana-like fruit. The cup displays a delicately pungent, roast-rounded acidity, rather lean mouthfeel, richly crisp lemon and background chocolate notes. The finish hovers on the rich side of astringent."
"Zimbabwe, Eastern Highlands, Zimbabwe","Low-toned, deep aroma with a tight-knit complexity: smoky chocolate, cherry. In the cup tartly sweet, with cherryish fruit laced with hints of chocolate and lemon. The cherry notes persist in the finish, fading toward a slight astringency in the long."
"Tanzania, Northern Tanzania","Low-toned and nut-like aroma with a hint of chocolate. In the cup round, simple but resonant, with fruit that carries hints of chocolate, red wine, orange perhaps. Rich and sweet in the short finish, a bit heavy in the long."
"Rwanda, Rwanda","Gentle, balanced, agreeably simple aroma, with distinct floral notes and a hint of milk chocolate. The floral tones carry into a soft, sweet cup with orange and a spice note that could qualify as cinnamon. Flattens a bit in the finish but remains sweet."
"Zimbabwe, Chipinge growing region, eastern Zimbabwe","Very sweet throughout the profile. Nut and semi-sweet chocolate notes in the aroma. In the cup tart coffee fruit notes make a distinct and delicate lean toward chocolate. The tart cherry tones persist in the sweet short finish, fading toward astringency in the long."
"Rwanda, Rwanda","Sweet, gently bright, delicately balanced aroma: milk chocolate, honey, a hint of tomato and cedar. In the cup softly acidy, silky in mouthfeel, quiet in flavor with hints of chocolate that carry into a simple but roundly clean finish."
"Tanzania, Mt. Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania","Deep, smoky, sweet-toned aroma with cedar and orange tones and an herby note. In the cup medium-bodied with a tickle of acidity, crisply sweet, gently smoky, with continued deep-toned orange or perhaps tangerine tones. The finish continues sweetly roasty and free of astringency."
"Zimbabwe, Eastern Zimbabwe","A big, sweetly acidy coffee, with distinct floral and molasses notes in both aroma and cup. The body is medium but the mouthfeel silky and supple. Tart coffee fruit notes in the cup lighten and complicate a slightly tight finish."
"Tanzania, Kigoma growing region, western Tanzania","Dominated throughout the profile by crisp, complex dry berry notes (think blackberries and cedar) with deep, sweet undercurrents of honey and chocolate that emerge with particular clarity as the cup cools. The tart berry notes also carry suggestions of dry, light-bodied red table wines."
"Tanzania, Mt. Meru region, Northern Tanzania","The dry, crisply pungent berry character we call black currant gently dominates throughout the profile. In the aroma it takes on a light-red-wine-like character, while in the cup it is enveloped in a quiet background sweetness. Soft acidity, delicate body, simple finish."
"Rwanda, Rwanda","Deeply and sweetly acidy throughout the profile. In the aroma intensely floral with orange, honey and pipe tobacco. In the cup the mouthfeel is syrupy, the acidity cherry-toned and lush. Sweet, rich finish with fine flavor persistence in the short, slight astringency in the long."
"Rwanda, Rwanda","Sweet-toned, soft aroma with flickers of flowers, chocolate and pear-like temperate fruit. In the cup quietly acidy, with a richly syrupy mouthfeel and a round, balanced structure. Continued flowers, chocolate and fruit, though in the cup the fruit is more honeyish date than pear. Simple, rich finish."
"Rwanda, Rwanda","Intense, complex but elegant aromatics – flowers, chocolate, butter (or perhaps butterscotch), cherryish fruit – carry from nose through cup into the short finish. The acidity is gentle and balanced, the mouthfeel lean but delicate."
"Ethiopia, Southern Ethiopia","Intense, sweet-toned, chocolate and blueberry aroma with a slight pungent edge. In the cup sweetly acidy, with a full, syrupy mouthfeel and lavish red wine and blueberry notes. The finish is rich, berry-toned and extraordinarily clean for this style of coffee."
"Indonesia, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia","Very rich aroma: tartly sweet, round-toned, with cherry- and orange-toned fruit. In the cup syrupy mouthfeel, sweet, with continued orangy fruit and a hint of moist leaves."
"India, Coorg growing region, southern India","An extraordinarily pure coffee in a dramatically light roast style. Sweet nut, fresh-cut cedar and orangy citrus in the aroma. Medium-bodied and giddily sweet in the cup, delicate but rich, with low, wine-toned acidity, an orange-toned fruit and hints of nut, flowers and chocolate. The complex fruit notes carry into a quietly rich, clean finish."
"Ethiopia, Sidamo growing region, southern Ethiopia","Very sweet-toned but crisp aroma: distinct lemon, floral and chocolate notes. In the cup big-bodied, with a dry, lemony chocolate simultaneously delicate yet intense. The chocolate takes on a breathtakingly sweet floral and blueberry character as the cup cools. Continued chocolate and flowers cover for a slight salty astringency in the long finish."
"Indonesia, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia","Deeply pungent, tightly complex aroma: grapefruit, earth, caramel, perhaps a hint of butter. In the cup fat bodied, sweetly pungent, with earth tones that lean toward a rich malt. The sweet-toned finish stays on the robust, rich side of astringent."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a “K-Cup” capsule to produce 6-ounce and 8-ounce serving sizes): Distinguished by a sweet, gently tart fruit note in aroma and cup that reads as a sort of crisp orange- and chocolate-toned blackberry – or call it “black currant,” a term for this flavor note in vogue among coffee describers. Whatever we call it, it is a precious and agreeable sensation. The body is medium and the mouthfeel silky at a 6-ounce serving, slightly thinnish and lean at 8. Rich finish with good flavor persistence and excellent stability as the cup cools."
"Hawaii, Kona growing district, """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii; other undisclosed growing regions","(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a “K-Cup” capsule to produce 6-ounce and 8-ounce serving sizes): The aroma displays a simple, pure coffee character: tartly sweet, chocolate-toned fruit and a hint of flowers. In the cup medium but silky bodied at 6 ounces, slightly thinnish at 8. At both serving sizes quite sweet, gently tart, with continued delicate chocolate-toned fruit notes. Nice persistence of chocolate and flowers in the finish, although this delicate, lyric coffee stiffens and simplifies a bit as the cup cools."
"Mexico, Chiapas State, southeastern Mexico","(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a “K-Cup” capsule at a serving size of 6 ounces): Rather subdued aroma, caramelly, with hints of flowers and chocolate. In the cup medium-bodied but silky in mouthfeel, simple and bittersweet, with distant hints of flowers, walnut, chocolate perhaps. Simple, rich, rather short finish."
"Costa_Rica, Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica","In the aroma roundly and sweetly acidy with floral-toned coffee fruit and a hint of chocolate. In the cup gently acidy, medium-bodied with a smooth, almost syrupy mouthfeel. The aromatics remain simple, dominated by a floral-toned coffee fruit (think tart pie cherries)."
"Indonesia, Toraja (formerly Kalossi) growing region, southwestern Celebes (now Sulawesi), Indonesia","An extreme version of the traditional musty/earthy coffees of Indonesia, with the musty notes so intense that they seem to push the profile into a realm completely outside ordinary expectations associated with coffee. The earthy mildew character is sharply pungent but sweet throughout, with associations with other pungently sweet sensations, like grapefruit and the fresh smell of tomato vine."
"Indonesia, East Java, Indonesia","Sweet-toned, mildly pungent aroma: cedar, molasses, a hint of milk chocolate. Very sweet in the cup and very delicate, with wispy walnut and continued milk chocolate notes. Surprisingly robust persistence of sweetness and flavor in the short finish; some astringency in the long."
"Indonesia, Toraja (formerly Kalossi) growing region, southwestern Celebes (now Sulawesi), Indonesia","Deep, rich, opulently sweet-toned aroma: cedar, hints of honey and orange. Heavy body and robustly rough mouthfeel in the cup, with a pungently earthy character that reads persuasively as a sort of dry but raisin-toned chocolate. The rich depth extends to the short finish, though astringency nags in the long."
"Indonesia, East Java, Indonesia","A quiet coffee. A subtle aromatic complex runs pleasantly through the profile from aroma through cup, so subtle it’s hard to pin down with specific associations: milk chocolate and banana I wrote for the aroma; switched to butterscotch for the cup, with a stiffening hint of walnut. The acidity is gently lively; the finish surprisingly rich given the quietness of the cup."
"Indonesia, East Java, Indonesia","A delicate – perhaps overly so – coffee that nevertheless rewards attentiveness to its subtle, complex aromatics: floral tones and a pungent note suggesting the fresh odor of tomato vines, with background suggestions of cocoa and white wine. A heavy astringency lurks in the mouthfeel that unfortunately dominates in the long finish as the heady aromatics fade."
"Indonesia, Toraja (formerly Kalossi) growing region, southwestern Celebes (now Sulawesi), Indonesia","A wonderfully sweet coffee whose lush character is balanced (or opposed) by a sharply musty earthiness. Taken together these tendencies read as a pungent citrus, grapefruit perhaps. Full body, very syrupy mouthfeel. Rich and very sweet in the short finish; in the long the musty tones introduce a mild astringency."
"Indonesia, East Java, Indonesia","More Sumatra than Java: pungent, sweet earth notes dominate with distinct chocolate and tomato leanings. The earthy chocolate notes carry into a sweet short finish, slightly astringent long."
"Indonesia, East Java, Indonesia","A strikingly distinctive coffee that suffers a bit in the finish. Splendid aroma: sweetly and deeply pungent, with floral, chocolate and pipe tobacco notes. In the cup low-toned but vibrant acidity, crisply nut-like with distinct orange notes. The nut notes turn very slightly stiff and dusty in the finish."
"Timor, East Timor","Almost sugary sweet throughout the profile. Flowers and cedar in the aroma; the floral notes give way to a more pungent, tomatoey fruit and hints of cocoa in the cup. The sweetness carries straight into a rich short finish, fading to a mild astringency in the long."
"Indonesia, Central Bali, Indonesia","Extraordinarily sweet-toned, lyrically delicate coffee, softly acidy, with orange, molasses, flowering grass and white wine notes. Clean, sweet, rich finish. Only a slight stiffening in the finish as the coffee cools holds this coffee back from an even higher rating."
"Timor, East Timor","Very sweet, almost sugary, with raisiny fruit notes and hints of orange and chocolate carrying with rich stateliness from aroma to cup. Syrupy body, deep, resonant finish."
"Indonesia, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia","The aroma is shifting, complex: sweet, smoky candied fruit suggests lemon drop at one moment, butterscotch the next; hints of flowers, fresh-fallen wet leaves, even milk chocolate. The influence of the sweet musty/earthy notes on the tart fruit becomes more explicit in the rich, gently pungent cup, reading as a sort of earthy lemon and fresh leather. Medium-bodied, syrupy mouthfeel. Sweetly rich finish."
"Costa_Rica, Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica","Sweet-toned, deeply pungent aroma with cedar and butter notes and a suggestion of bittersweet chocolate. In the cup rather lean-bodied, delicately and cleanly roasty, but with limited nuance: butter, hints of chocolate and flowers. The chocolate implicit throughout the profile emerges with surprising and pleasing clarity in the finish, outlasting even a slight astringency."
"Hawaii, South Kona growing district, """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","A simple but sweet, deeply resonant coffee with a big, smooth body and chocolate-toned fruit notes that read as a round, banana-inclined milk chocolate in the aroma. In the cup the chocolate turns toward cocoa and the fruit toward a gently tart, cherryish coffee fruit. Rich, straightforward finish with a very slight hint of astringency."
"Thailand, Northern Thailand","A quiet but interesting coffee: soft, low-toned, with hints of cedar, warm spice, chocolate, and a low-acid fruit that suggests banana. The chocolate notes become more explicit in the impressively long, resonant finish."
"El_Salvador, El Salvador","Delicate, gently bright coffee with distinct, cedar-toned dry berry notes (the kind often called black currant) carrying from aroma to cup, support by cocoa, orange (perhaps better, tangerine) and floral nuance. The body is rather light, but the mouthfeel is gently lively, almost effervescent. Clean, rich finish with impressive flavor persistence, particularly of the orange/cocoa notes."
"Colombia, Huila Department, southern Colombia","A deeply floral-toned coffee. The floral tones are rich and rose-like in both aroma and cup, with caramelly, almost custard-like support and hints of cedar and cocoa. The finish is sweet, deep and long."
"Guatemala, Guatemala","A versatile espresso with a pungent authority that should serve particularly well in big milk drinks. Slightly spicy, apricot- or mango-toned fruit in the deeply sweet-impressioned aroma. In the small cup displays full, syrupy body and a rather opulently sweet, chocolate-toned richness with a balancing cedar pungency. Slight astringency in the long finish. In milk rounds and blossoms nicely but dominates with semi-sweet chocolate authority and a slight but discernible astringent edge in the finish."
"Costa_Rica, Costa Rica","Crisp, elegant espresso with dry berry and floral notes. Shows a hint of sweet, tomato-toned acidity in the aroma along with caramel and flowers. In the small cup surprisingly full-bodied with cedar, dry berry and a continuing shimmer of flowers. Clean, rich finish. Masters milk with a delicate, dry-chocolate-toned authority. The floral notes survive with startling clarity in milk, persisting far into the finish."
"Kenya, South-central Kenya","Quietly intense aroma, softly and sweetly high-toned, dry berry notes. In the cup medium-bodied with a silky mouthfeel, with the mild acidy edge and tart dry berry notes enveloped in sweetness, netting a floral, Riesling-like buoyancy."
"Colombia, Colombia","Round, rich aroma with distinct butter notes and hints of flowers and lemon. Simplifies in the cup: good body and a sweet, gently crisp structure, but little nuance."
"Bolivia, Bolivia","Superb, richly sweet-toned aroma: semi-sweet chocolate with hints of raisins and cedar. In the cup rather lean-bodied, delicate, with crisp, very distinct cocoa-chocolate notes nuanced by hints of lemon, caramel, raisin."
"Bolivia, Caranavi region, north of La Paz, Bolivia","Soft, sweet-toned aroma with limited but pleasing nuance: cedar, perhaps tomato. Remains sweet in the cup, crisply delicate, with very pronounced sweet cocoa tones. Superb finish: sweet, long and cocoa-laced."
"Colombia, Huila Department, southern Colombia","Crisply sweet-toned aroma with cedar and butter notes. In the cup silky mouthfeel and a quiet, tight-knit complexity: distinct cocoa and hints of cedar, orange, flowers, butter. Smooth, gently rich, very persistent and pleasing finish."
"Colombia, Valle de Cauca Department, western Colombia","Sweet-toned aroma with delicate floral-, cherry- and chocolate-toned fruit notes. In the cup more striking for its superb body and balanced structure than for its agreeable but limited nuance, a dry cherry-chocolate. The long, deep finish stays just on the rich side of astringent."
"Peru, Quillabamba region, south-central Peru","Rather thin aroma, with semi-sweet chocolate hints. In the cup the chocolate turns explicit, crisp and pleasantly cocoaish. The finish is surprisingly rich, with continued cocoa tones and a hint of flowers. The cup generally relaxes and plumps up as it cools."
"Colombia, Narino Department, southern Colombia","Very sweet-toned aroma with orange and pipe-tobacco notes. In the cup rich, wine-like acidity, syrupy mouthfeel, and a delicate yet rich structure with continued orange and fresh pipe-tobacco notes. Rich, long, sweet finish."

"Colombia, San Agust?n growing region, Huila Department, southern Colombia","Sweetly tart aroma complicated by coffee fruit (think pie cherries) and hints of cedar and cocoa. The cup is dominated by a giddily sweet, buoyantly intense acidity with continued notes of fresh coffee fruit and flowers. Short but rich finish."
"Colombia, Tolima growing region, south-central Colombia","Sweet-toned and alive with a dense, shifting complexity. Cedar, orange, distinct butterscotch, tomato, perhaps chocolate in the aroma. In the cup low-toned acidity and lightly syrupy in mouthfeel, with an almost sugary sweetness and tight-knit notes of butterscotch, caramel, honey, ripe but slightly tart orange. Rich and sweet in the short finish, though a slight hint of astringency surfaces in the long."
"Colombia, Narino Department, southern Colombia","A classic cup: pure, simple, intense, refined. Sweet-toned but crisp aroma: tomato, cedar, cardamom, chocolate. Richly and sweetly acidy in the cup with the classic complex of flowers and fresh coffee fruit with rounding hints of chocolate."
"Colombia, Cauca Department, southern Colombia","An aromatically rather simple coffee with a tremendous relaxed and almost voluptuous structure. In the aroma low-toned and round with hints of flowers and cherry-toned fruit. Softly acidy and sweetly and deeply rich in the cup. Sweet, almost sugary finish."
"Colombia, Cauca Department, southern Colombia","Sweet-toned, quietly complex aroma: cherryish, chocolate-toned fruit with a hint of herby cedar. In the cup softly acidy and richly and exquisitely balanced, with the fruit taking on a distinct black cherry character. A coffee whose excellence ultimately lies in its suave authority and completeness."
"Colombia, Huila Department, southern Colombia","Quietly intense aroma, cedar and distinct butterscotch notes. Plushly heavy body in the sweet, deep-toned cup, with almost port-like red wine tones and rich hints of semi-sweet chocolate and roses anchored on a flinty, almost mineral-like base."
"Colombia, Tolima growing region, south-central Colombia","Exhilaratingly intense but roundly sweet-toned aroma: black cherry, flowers, milk chocolate, with an underlying cedar-toned crispness. Sweet flowers and cherry dominate in the cup with an almost symphonic richness of tone. Medium bodied but silky mouthfeel. The floral notes linger into the farthest reaches of the finish."
"Mexico, Chiapas State, southeastern Mexico","Rich, simple aroma: cedar and butter. In the cup agreeably deep-toned and round, with chocolate and continued butter notes. Good body, soft acidity. Continues consistent into the simple but sweet, rich finish."
"Kenya, South-Central Kenya","Intense, complex, yet balanced aroma: chocolate, caramel, cedar, flowers, tomato. In the cup the acidity is powerful but juicily sweet, the flavor alive with shifting hints of flowers, citrus and wine. Long, gently astringent finish."
"Colombia, Colombia","Sweet, round but crisp profile. Attractive nuance in the aroma – raisin, cedar, pipe tobacco, a hint of chocolate – fades quickly in the cup, leaving behind only the faintest shimmer of floral-toned chocolate. Sweet, distantly chocolate-toned finish, but quite astringent in the mouthfeel."
"Hawaii, The Kona growing region of the Big Island of Hawaii and other undisclosed origins","Subdued, sweet-toned aroma: cedar, hints of chocolate and prune-toned fruit. Round, simple, and rather richly bittersweet in the cup, with some hints of flowers, chocolate and prune. Deep, resonant short finish thins toward astringency in the long."
"East_Africa, East Africa","A very interesting profile, shallow in depth of sensation but intensely complex within that narrow range.

"Colombia, Colombia","Intense aroma vivid with tart cherry notes and hints of chocolate and tomato. Big, giddily sweet acidity with continued pie cherry notes with a lush lean toward chocolate. Very slightly astringent in the long finish."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing district, southern Ethiopia","Pungently bittersweet, rather austere coffee. Deep aroma, with tomato and rosemary notes and perhaps some semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup, rich, simple, bittersweet with continued tomato, Mediterranean herb and semi-sweet chocolate notes."
"Kenya, Central Kenya","A coffee at once voluptuous and austere. Delicately complex aroma: flowers, chocolate, tobacco leaves, lemon grass. In the cup an amazingly rich, wine-like acidity, sweet flowers, and a gently crisp, dry berry fruit. Hints of chocolate re-emerge in the cleanly long, almost perfect finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Very sweet-toned, exquisitely balanced aroma with floral, candied lemon and sweet herb notes. In the cup intense, tartly sweet acidity and buoyant mouthfeel with white wine and continued sweet lemon notes. The barest hint of chocolate in the cup blooms with soft explicitness in the surprisingly sweet finish. The cup stiffens ever so slightly as it cools."
"El_Salvador, El Salvador","Dark chocolate and caramel in the aroma. Luscious body, cherry-laced dark chocolate in the cup."
"El_Salvador, El Salvador","Cocoa and caramel aroma. Blazing acidity, dark chocolate and caramel, regal balance. A nicely conducted, relatively light roast makes this balanced but assertive coffee particularly well-suited for vacuum pot and drip brewing."
"Nicaragua, Madriz growing region, Nicaragua",Crisply acidy but big-bodied and lavishly chocolate-toned. Vanilla bean complicates the chocolate in the finish. A tactful match of roast to coffee.
"Nicaragua, Madriz growing region, Nicaragua","Huge body, luscious Belgian chocolate flavor with plenty of supporting acidity. Vanilla bean along with the chocolate in the finish. Roast is perfectly matched to the coffee."
"El_Salvador, El Salvador","Mouth watering dark chocolate laced with butter caramel and black cherry, subtler flavors of cigar leaves and mace. Razor sharp acidity.  Extraordinary concentration, vigor and balance. Exceptionally skillful, tender roast that lets the coffee shine."
"Nicaragua, Nueva Segovia growing region, Nicaragua","Cocoa and dark chocolate aroma, vigorous flavors of dark chocolate laced with cherry, medium-full body, intense, focused acidity, great purity. Ideally roasted."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Spectacularly aromatic in both dry and infused aroma: candied lemon peel, bergamot, hints of jasmine. Medium bodied and sweet, with superb acidity and flavors that suggest both the mentholated citrus of a Yirgacheffe and the blueberry notes of a Harrar, but without a trace of ferment or earthiness. Perfumed perfection."
"El_Salvador, El Salvador","Cocoa laced with citrus in the aroma. Flavors are as complex and sculpted as a top Alsatian Riesling, with intense lemon and orange acidity, chocolate, and a suggestion of fresh chive or tarragon always associated with this variety.  A powerful, aristocratic grand cru. This fragile, low-density variety is a major challenge to roast (and cannot handle dark roasting); this is a particularly masterful roasting job."
"El_Salvador, El Salvador","Chocolate and citrus on the break. Regal acidity, complex flavors of chocolate, citrus and herbs. A powerful, intense and demanding cup. Haunting, persistent finish. Perfect roast of this especially challenging bean. What great coffee is all about."
"Nicaragua, Jinotega growing region, north-central Nicaragua","Deep, sweetly pungent aroma: cedar, banana-like fruit, a hint of flowers. Big-bodied in the cup, with continued pungently sweet character and limited nuance, mainly cedar and some cedar-toned chocolate. Simple but rich in the finish."
"Hawaii, North Kona growing district, Big Island of Hawaii","Sweetly pungent aroma with hints of chocolate, cedar, low-acid fruit, pear perhaps. In the cup medium-bodied but silky in mouthfeel, with great sweetness, a roast-muted tartness, elegant floral notes and coffee fruit turned toward cocoa under the influence of the roast. Rich, sweet and cocoa-toned in the short finish, rather astringent in the long."
"Indonesia, Toraja growing region, southwestern Sulawesi, Indonesia","Intense, gently pungent aroma with great, low-toned complexity: vanilla, honey, caramel, banana, semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup a heavy bittersweetness and rough mouthfeel initially dominate, but as the cup begins to cool a honeyish sweetness and rich semi-sweet chocolate emerge and persist into the finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Delicate, lyrically sweet-toned aroma with flowers, flowering grass and a lush shimmer of molasses. In the cup delicate but intense, with sweetly tart, white-wine-toned acidity, light-bodied but silky mouthfeel, and continued fresh, aromatic grass notes. Surprisingly rich in the short finish with a shadow of grassy astringency in the long."
"Kenya, Nyeri growing region, south-central Kenya","An intense coffee dominated from aroma through finish by a rich, tartly sweet acidity and high-toned lemon and dry berry notes. The finish, like the entire profile, is as deeply sweet as it is uncompromisingly dry."
"Ethiopia, Kefa (Kaffa) Province, southwestern Ethiopia","Very complete aroma: pungently acidy but sweet-toned, with fat banana-like fruit and chocolate hints. In the cup gently round, rich acidity, medium body, silky mouthfeel, and distinct orange, lavender and fresh pipe tobacco notes with a little chocolate lean toward the finish. Excellent flavor persistence in the long, complex finish."
"Kenya, Kirinyaga growing district, Central Kenya","Vividly lively yet elegantly smooth coffee. Intense aroma with tart cherry and round, low-acid fruit notes, banana perhaps, with hints of fresh leather. In the cup sweet, lyric acidity, light but silky mouthfeel, cherry and cocoa notes. Rich, sweet, deeply long finish."
"Brazil, Ribeirao do Pinhal region, State of Parana, Brazil","Sweet-toned aroma but rather quiet: raisin, dark chocolate, walnut, floral complication.

"Brazil, Ribeirao do Pinhal region, State of Parana, Brazil","A mid-toned, gently crisp coffee. Rich aroma with semi-sweet chocolate, raisin, walnut, perhaps orange complication. In the cup, full though slightly rough body with a continued dry, semi-sweet chocolate character and hints of walnut and orangy raisin. Rich, simple, slightly heavy finish."
"Brazil, South-Central Brazil","Fine, delicate aroma: sweet-toned with floral top notes and a hint of dark chocolate. In the small cup medium-bodied and sweet but rather simple: some continued dark chocolate notes and raisiny fruit. In milk remains sweetly delicate and restrained."
"Ethiopia, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Sweet, lyric fruit in the aroma: cherry, chocolate-toned blueberry. The fruit mutes in the small cup but the underlying structure is pleasing: rich, intense, medium-bodied and silky in mouthfeel. The berry notes carry into the slightly heavy finish. The blueberry character fattens nicely in milk, though the chocolate side of the flavor complex remains a bit tight and restrained."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia",A delicate but intense lemony chocolate dominates from aroma through demitasse to milk. The lemon-toned chocolate is lavish and sweet in the aroma; in the small cup tartly sweet; in finish pleasantly persistent despite a slight astringency. In milk the lemon mutes while the chocolate rounds out lushly.
"Indonesia, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia","(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a “K-Cup” capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): Smoke and earth notes in the aroma are brightened by a hint of floral-toned vanilla. In the cup, low-toned acidity, substantial body, and continued smoke, earth and floral notes rounded by a quiet caramel sweetness."
"Guatemala, Huehuetenango growing region, Guatemala","Intense, deeply rich aroma dominated by cedar notes with hints of plum or prune that lean toward semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup smooth and substantial in mouthfeel, powerful and balanced, but limited in nuance. Like the cup, the finish is structurally impressive (rich, clean) but simple."
"Indonesia, Toraja growing region, southwestern Sulawesi, Indonesia","Hints of banana-toned fruit, chocolate, fresh-baked bread in the complex but rather listless aroma. Thin though silky mouthfeel. Pungent, gently burned cedar character in the cup, with floral and caramelly chocolate suggestions. Nicely malty finish, but a hint of burned building rubber."
"Mexico, Chiapas State, Mexico","Orange, raisiny chocolate, and pungent herbal notes in the aroma. Delicate in the cup, with continued orange-chocolate and pungent herb notes. Slightly bitter in the short finish, but smoothes out and sweetens nicely in the long."
"Ethiopia, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","A sweet fruit ferment contributes to an intense aromatic complexity that carries from nose to cup: Spicy, rose-like flowers, honey, blueberry, ripe peach, a hint of chocolate. The finish is rich and blueberry-toned, but cup and finish both stiffen just a bit as the coffee cools, revealing a hint of heavy astringency."
"Nicaragua, Neuva Segovia growing region, Nicaragua","Nut, prune, cedar and citrus, perhaps grapefruit, in the rich, low-toned aroma. Very sweet in the cup, pungent, with continued walnut and citrus notes and suggestions of earth or moist leaves. Everything settles toward chocolate in the rich finish. The cup roughens very slightly as it cools."
"Costa_Rica, Central Costa Rica","Intense aroma: tart cherry, caramel, hints of lemon, flowers, chocolate. In the cup delicate and pure: brings the fresh, dusky floral and tart cherry notes of coffee flowers and fruit into the cup with continuing hints of chocolate and lemon. The finish is clean, simple, ingenuous."
"Colombia, Cauca growing region, southern Colombia","A whisper of an aroma, but a complex one: flowering grass, caramel, honey, a hint of chocolate. Amazingly sweet and delicately lush in the cup, with the honey notes intensifying and the floral notes declaring as spicy tea rose. The honey and floral notes persist in the surprisingly long, resonant finish."
"Panama, Boquete growing region, western Panama","Cherry notes dominate in the very sweet-toned, pungently acidy aroma. Relatively light-bodied in the cup, but sweetly and buoyantly acidy, with striking and complex aromatic notes: cherry, tea rose, Meyer Lemon, orange, honey. Honey in particular persists in the rich, sweet, though slightly astringent finish."
"Colombia, Huila Department, southern Colombia","A deep, spicy floral character – dusk flowers, tea rose – leads in aroma and cup, supported by low-acid fruit notes – peach, cherry – and hints of milk chocolate and leather. The acidity is deep-toned and round, the finish rich and clean."
"Kenya, South-Central Kenya","Pungent but sweet throughout the profile. In the aroma caramel, fruit-toned, slightly smoky cedar, orange. In the cup the pungent, smoky fruit notes read as a tartly sweet grapefruit, perhaps dry berry, with continuing undercurrents of caramel sweetness. Distinct orange notes resurface in the rich finish."
"Ethiopia, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Powerful, sweet-toned aroma: cherry, honey, tea-rose, milk chocolate, with a very mild ferment that reads as delicate Riesling-like wine. In the cup the honey and rose-like floral notes persist lushly, with the fruit notes turning from dark cherry to a tarter coffee fruit. The felicitous ferment deepens, reading more as brandy than wine. The finish is rich and deep, with an attractive persistence of flower, cherry and honey, but is weighed by the astringent heaviness usual with even the best of this style of dry-processed coffee."
"Kenya, Nyeri growing region, south-central Kenya","Intense, lyrically sweet coffee: honey, flowers and the pure notes of coffee fruit carry from aroma to cup; the acidity is tart but caramelly, even buttery. Impeccably clean, delicately rich finish."
"Indonesia, Lake Tawar basin, Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia","In the aroma intense, pungent with grapefruit and cedar notes. In the cup full-bodied, with the dominating earthy pungency enveloped in deep sweetness. Continued grapefruit, pineapple and cedar notes settle toward honey and chocolate. Sweet, resonant, rich finish, totally free of astringency."
"Indonesia, Lake Tawar basin, Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia","Tartly sweet fruit notes suggest pineapple, grapefruit or perhaps black currant in the aroma, with delicate undercurrents of caramel and earth. In the cup the musty/malty earth notes move richly forward, backgrounding the continuing crisp, pineapply fruit. A slight astringency in the short finish gives way to sweetness and pineapple in the long."
"Thailand, Thailand","In the aroma richly pungent with low-toned, rather subdued nuance: hints of banana, cedar, date perhaps. In the cup quiet, balanced, bittersweet, with faint whispers of nutmeg, raw date, butter, aromatic wood, all persisting into the rich finish."
"Colombia, San Agustin growing region, Huila Department, southern Colombia","Roses, milk chocolate and a hint of aromatic wood in the aroma. Crisp and richly delicate in the cup, with continued hints of aromatic wood, spicy rose and a sweet chocolate. The finish is simple but clean and rich."
"South_America, Central and South America","Both co-cupper Danny O’Neill (83) and Ken (87) admired an aroma that was “sweet and spicy” for Danny, “rich, deep and sweetly smoky” for Ken. For Danny the cup was “muddled” and woody, for Ken slightly astringent in structure but nevertheless pleasantly bittersweet with a rich cocoa character that strengthened as the coffee cooled."
"East_Africa, East Africa","An exciting coffee that disappoints in the finish. Ken (88) was more forgiving than co-cupper Danny O’Neill (83), who sums up: “Bright and clean in the nose, this coffee’s lusciously thick and smooth body rounds its slightly fruity, almost wine-like, acidity. Sweet honey and fruit flavors become sharp and  … astringent in the long finish.”  Perhaps the dry-processed Ethiopias in this blend are last year’s crop, with their explosive aromatics too faded to compensate for an underlying mildly astringent structure."
"Indonesia, Toraja growing region, southwestern Sulawesi, Indonesia","Very sweet-toned, quietly complex aroma: smoke, semi-sweet chocolate and tart berryish fruit notes. Little of the aromatic complexity survives in the lean-bodied cup, only wisps of nut and crisp, smoky chocolate that fade quickly in the finish, leaving behind faint sweetness and a muted astringency."
"Costa_Rica, Tarrazu growing region, central Costa Rica","In the aroma cedar plus flowers and roast-influenced caramel and banana notes. A roast-muted acidity gently lifts the cup, where the cedar and caramel notes persist while the banana-toned fruit notes drift toward chocolate. Quiet short finish with a slight astringency in the long. Reader Ed Escobar says he has been “impressed by the consistent quality and freshness” of the coffees he has been buying from Old Bisbee Roasters."
"Guatemala, Guatemala","A cup either pleasingly delicate or disappointingly simple depending on taste and expectation. Balanced, gentle aroma with a very fresh, foresty cedar and a suggestion of pear-toned fruit. In the cup the cedar and fruit tones finally settle into a sweet, raisin-toned chocolate. Reader Laura Cheng nominated another Central American coffee from Caffe Vita that was not available, so we took the liberty of ordering this one instead."
"Colombia, Tolima Department, Colombia","Fine aroma: high-toned, elegant, combining suggestions of flowers, lemon, cedar and peach in a single suave, tight-knit aromatic gesture. In the cup delicately rich, light-bodied but not lean, gently acidy. The peach-floral-lemon gesture deepens and leans toward chocolate. Only the finish is disappointing: short and slightly but distractingly astringent."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, southern Ethiopia","The aroma is intense and complex: cherry, blueberry, brandy, chocolate, with an underlying edge of pungently spicy cedar. All carry richly into the cup with an excitement a bit too edgy for elegance. A slight shadow of astringency lurking in the cup emerges clearly in the long finish."
"Ethiopia, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Opulently complex aroma: cherry, blueberry, dry semi-sweet chocolate, brandy. In the cup very sweet, gently rich; the chocolate grows rounder and more distinct with continued blueberry and brandy complication. The rich, dry brandy notes dominate a slight astringency in the finish."
"Guatemala, Antigua valley, central Guatemala","Simple but classically appealing coffee. High-toned, sweetly spicy aroma with tight-knit suggestions of flowers, chocolate and sweet tomato that amplify in the richly acidy cup. The finish stays on the roundly hearty side of astringent."
"Bolivia, Carrasco growing region, Bolivia","The attraction of this coffee is a structure both powerful and elegant: richly and roundly acidy, with silky-verging-on-syrupy mouthfeel, fundamental sweetness, and ringing depth of sensation. The wispy hints of chocolate, cherry and cedar are a bonus. Reader Mike Venditto’s nomination of a Counter Culture coffee was not available, so we substituted this rather similar Bolivia."
"Brazil, South-Central Brazil","Sweet-toned, intense aroma with walnut and chocolate notes and a hint of peach-like fruit. In the cup gentle, delicate, sweet, with a pleasantly vegetal cocoa character, a continued hint of fruit, and walnut tones that turn just a bit flat and woody as the cup cools. Delicate, pleasing but simple finish with continued walnut notes."
"Brazil, South-Central Brazil","Deep, pungently sweet aroma with cocoa, caramelly cedar, raisin, date and honey notes. In the cup rich, low-key, gently bittersweet with continued, very distinct cocoa and honey/date notes. Long finish with excellent flavor persistence. The cup flattens slightly as it cools."
"Brazil, South-Central Brazil","A gently sweet, ingratiating coffee. In the aroma caramel, cedar and orange notes with a hint of flowers. In the cup very sweet, with a dominating fruit-toned cocoa that carries into the long, clean finish."
"Brazil, Mogiana growing region, Sao Paulo State, south-central Brazil","Very deep, richly fruity aroma: banana, raisin perhaps, hints of chocolate and rose-like flowers. In the small cup the body is full and syrupy, the flavor simple, deep-toned, with cedar and tart fruit notes – tamarind perhaps – the finish rich and long. Masters milk with an understated balance and a soft persistence of banana, cedar and chocolate notes."
"Ethiopia, Sumatra, Ethiopia","Superb fruity, caramelly aroma with distinct brandy and chocolate notes. In the small cup medium body, dominated by caramel and cedar notes with only a hint of cherryish brandy intrigue. The fruity brandy tones intensify in the finish, though with a very slight bitterish edge. They reach their apotheosis in milk, however, where they finally free themselves from their slight bitter shadow and bloom with lush, powerful expressiveness."
"Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe growing region, Sidamo Province, southern Ethiopia","Delicately soft aroma: dusk-blooming flowers, lemon, a hint of milk chocolate and caramel. In the small cup medium to light in body but smooth in mouthfeel, with continued lemon and floral top notes working above gently pungent cedar and semi-sweet chocolate mid-tones. Sweet, long, roundly lemony finish. In milk just on the edge of thin-bodied, but the lemony chocolate flavor notes are distinctive and superb."
"Nicaragua, Madriz, Nicaragua","Delicate but deep aroma: flowers, orange, peach, with a suggestion of chocolate. In the small cup smooth, substantial mouthfeel, sweetly crisp in flavor with hints of cedar, lemon, and dry-toned peach. Resonant, impeccably clean finish. Chocolate and fresh leather in milk, with continued complicating hints of peach and orange."
"India, Southern India","Deep, very sweet-toned aroma, with chocolate, flowers, walnut, and a hint of carnal fruit – peach or papaya. In the small cup very full body, but not heavy – the mouthfeel is lively, almost effervescent. In flavor very sweet, very deep, with cedar and a gently spicy semi-sweet chocolate. Superb finish: long, caramelly, rich. Exerts a simple but powerful presence in milk: sweet milk chocolate with perhaps a shimmer of flowers."
"Hawaii, Kona growing district, """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","Pungent, spicy or perhaps smoky aroma, with caramel notes and a hint of apple. In the cup rather sharply acidy with very distinct caramel notes and not much else. A bright, simple, limited coffee."
"Hawaii, Kona growing district, """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","A contradictory coffee, with sweetly buoyant flowering grass and vanilla notes shimmering above a pungent heaviness in both aroma and cup. The pungent notes hint at semi-sweet chocolate in the aroma but turn rather bitter in the cup, compromising the continuing agreeable floral character."
"Hawaii, Kaanapali district, near Lahaina, West Maui, Hawaii","Fermented fruit contributes to a glorious aroma dominated by a sort of dry, nutty chocolate. In the cup very sweet and floral but also quite astringent, netting a wildly ambiguous profile with intriguing fruit notes too astringent to call chocolate and too explosively fermented to call winy. Unorthodox palates might assign high ratings to this unusual coffee, while purists surely would choke and dismiss it. We compromised at 85 – buyers beware."
"Hawaii, South Kona growing district, """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","Sweetly roasty throughout the profile: fresh-cut cedar and hints of cardamom and flowers in the aroma; in the cup silky in mouthfeel, very sweet, with continuing cedar and intensified floral notes. Slightly astringent, almost turpenny in the long finish."
"Hawaii, Kona growing district, """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","Fine aroma: delicate but deep, with milk chocolate, floral and caramelly fruit notes, apple perhaps. In the cup softly acidy, velvety in mouthfeel; the chocolate turns toward sweet cocoa with a richly tart floral twist. Surprisingly long finish, but also surprisingly heavy and even astringent. Cups were slightly uneven with occasional very faint musty fermented suggestions as they cooled, so a rating that started at 90 ended at an ambivalent 87."
"Hawaii, Kona growing district, """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","High-toned, delicate (almost too) aroma: flowers, caramel, pipe tobacco. A bit sharp and astringent in the cup, but with a richly rounding caramel character and fine floral top notes. The caramel settles toward chocolate in the finish."
"Hawaii, Kona growing district, """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","Simple, rather subdued aroma: cherry and chocolate notes. In the cup rich, pungent and sweet, but aromatically simple: dried cherries, a hint of chocolate, perhaps suggestions of merlot-like red wine."
"Hawaii, Kona growing district, """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","Classic aroma: cleanly high-toned, slightly acidy, with flowers, peach, and a hint of milk chocolate. In the cup sweetly and brightly acidy, with continued floral, peach and black currant notes. The flavor drops off in a rather disappointing finish."
"Hawaii, Kona growing district, """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","Rich aroma: semi-sweet chocolate and suggestions of apple, with floral notes at the top. In the cup rather big-bodied and rich, with continuing distinct floral top notes and a rather dominating, roundly tart acidity that nearly overwhelms but still allows further suggestions of chocolate, ripe tomato, orange and cedar."
"Hawaii, South Kona growing district, """"Big Island"""" of Hawaii","Roundly delicate aroma: chocolate and caramel notes with suggestions of flowers and ripe tomato. In the cup silky mouthfeel and a classic profile: tart fruitiness enveloped in a giddy sweetness that harbors continued hints of chocolate and flowers. Clean, sweet – almost sugary – finish."
"South_America, Central and South America","(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a “K-Cup” capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): A coffee either pleasingly subtle and delicate or disappointingly subdued and shallow depending on taste and expectation. Caramel, flowers and a hint of smoke or perhaps cinnamon in the aroma. In the cup gently acidy, light-bodied but silky in mouthfeel and mild in flavor, with hints of caramel, cocoa, pear and sweet flowering grass. Very sweet but simple finish."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Highlands of Papua New Guinea","Most cups of this sample were very sweet in aroma and flavor, with soft earth tones (think the odor of freshly fallen, moist leaves that have just begun to compost), and pleasingly round cherry, cocoa and caramel notes. Unfortunately one cup of five was very, very foul tasting, probably owing to a bad bean called a “stinker,” so we deducted 4 points from a coffee that otherwise might merit a 90."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Highlands of Papua New Guinea","Softly sweet-toned, rather simple aroma – raisin and chocolate notes. In the cup a lean but rather silky mouthfeel, with continued raisin and sweet pipe tobacco notes and a continued lean toward milk chocolate. Simple, straightforward finish with a shimmer of astringency in the long."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Highlands of Papua New Guinea","Simple but deep aroma, with resonant raisiny chocolate tones. In the cup lean-bodied, delicate, fundamentally sweet and rather lush but dryly smoky with a hint of fruit that reads as white wine or grapefruit. Concludes simply but richly."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Highlands of Papua New Guinea","Deep, sweet-toned, buttery aroma with a spicy, cedary chocolate and a hint of fruit, pear perhaps. In the cup delicately robust, with a roundly lush but continuing spicy, cedary, almost black-peppery chocolate and a suggestion of coconut, the sweet processed kind. Roundly rich finish."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Highlands of Papua New Guinea","Very sweet, caramelly aroma with milk chocolate notes and hints of earth and cedar. In the cup richly acidy, with continued caramel and milk chocolate notes. Rather limited in nuance but not a lazy cup; a simple, straightforwardly pleasing gesture."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Highlands of Papua New Guinea","Sweetly smoky, cedary aroma with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup a particularly full body and creamy mouthfeel, sweetly and richly acidy, but with limited nuance – hints of cedar and tart cherry, perhaps a continuing suggestion of semi-sweet chocolate. Simple but sweetly rich finish."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Okapa Valley, Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea","Softly low-toned fruit – bananas, semi-sweet chocolate – with a twist of cedar in the aroma. In the cup sweetly earthy with a fruit that displays a hint of ferment. Together this package reads as an earthy orange or raisin with a lean toward semi-sweet chocolate. Quietly rich, slightly rough finish with a pleasingly persistent earthy chocolate character."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Kainantu district, Eastern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea","Sweetly smoky, deep-toned aroma with fruit notes that suggest a sort of chocolaty papaya. In the cup deeply and fundamentally sweet, with spicy, smoky tones and a lush fruit that again suggested chocolate, but with a sweet grapefruit cast. Clean, rich, long finish."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Highlands of Papua New Guinea","Delicate aroma with softly pungent cedar and sweet tomato notes. In the cup gently and crisply acidy, with distinct floral notes and coffee fruit that reads as a tart, chocolate-toned cherry. A simple but very pure coffee expression."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Wahgi Valley, Western Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea","Delicate but deep aroma, with chocolate, pipe tobacco and leather notes. In the cup earthy but richly sweet, almost sugary, with cherry fruit notes that acquire a chocolate depth in the profoundly sweet finish."
"Papua_New_Guinea, Wahgi Valley, Western Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea","Sweet-toned, delicate aroma with butter notes and hints of chocolate and Mediterranean spice. Even sweeter in the cup, still delicate but rich, softly acidy and quietly complex with distinct floral notes and a crisp, subtle fruit that suggests Riesling table wine or perhaps black currant. The fruit notes turn toward cocoa in the long, continuing sweet finish."
"Bolivia, Calama growing region, Bolivia","Heady, intense aroma: milk chocolate, leather, flowers, sweet lemon and tomato. In the cup a richly tart acidity dominates, rounded by sweetness but bold and uncompromising. Lemon and sweet tomato notes lean toward chocolate. As the cup cools the acidity softens toward a clean, sweet finish, bracing but astringency free."
