And for some folks, decaf is the only option no matter what time of day it is! These coffee enthusiasts are the truest coffee fanatics to us": " they love coffee without the added benefit of an energy boost. For years now we've kept our decaf selections to Water Processed coffees, whether they be from the Canadian Swiss Water facility or the Mountain Water facility in Mexico. Compared to older decaf methods, water processed decaf is significantly more environmentally friendly and leaves behind, in our opinion, the best flavor profile post decaffeination. Well consider that opinion officially changed because there's a new competitor for that title now."

The site relies on a team of brothers, Seleshi and Degafe Beyene, to manage the cherry collection from all contributing growers, as well as 190 staff members who manage the day-to-day natural processing during harvest. Incoming cherry to the site is inspected upon arrival for uniform ripeness and defect, and then immediately laid out to dry on the site’s raised beds, a process that typically takes 3-4 weeks. Despite being a young company, EDN has already begun investigating novel processing equipment and techniques. The company is experimenting with an electronic color sorter for precise cherry selection, something that has existed as a prototype for a number of years but has yet to really penetrate into the producer industry. In addition, the company is working with honey processing and anaerobic fermentation techniques across their processing sites, continuously chasing a portfolio of coffee profiles they believe will best serve their farmers and help the industry achieve new ideals.\" - Royal Coffee"

The coffee producing communities throughout Gedeb are larger here than in central Gedeo and can reach some of the highest growing elevations for coffee in the world. Worka Sakaro processing station was started by Mijane Woresa in 2011. For its first few years the station sold coffee the way most producers in the area did": " through the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX), where government cuppers would grade and position the coffee for sale to exporters. In 2017 Mr. Woresa secured an export license for himself, and, after 30 years of work in coffee, brought his son Daniel aboard, who then started a relationship with Royal. Today, Daniel Mijane runs the majority of day-to-day operations at the family’s two private stations (the other is in Halo Hartume, in the Northern corner of Gedeb), as well as the exporting itself.\" - Royal Coffee"

            "Captain's Coffee regulars know I tend to get more excited by natural processed Ethiopian coffees than washed. This was a very rare exception. First let's start with why Gedeb is exciting": " As Royal Coffee mentions above, even washed coffees from Gedeb tend to be super fruity like most naturals while still retaining excellent balance and a clean cup. Next, GRADE ZERO?! For those who don't know, Ethiopia has changed their grading system a bit over the years. Currently, all Ethiopian coffees whether washed or natural are graded 1 through 4 in order to designate their average number of defects as well as how closely sized they are. Grade one has the least number of defects and the beans are sized all nearly identically. Grade four has the most number of defects and the beans are quite mixed in size. Grade zero doesn't even exist...until now."

More than 500 acres have been converted into natural forest and coffee cultivation is managed with organic inputs. Manure from more than 2000 sheep grazing on the estate is used as a major source of organic fertilizer. During the harvest, cherries are picked and transported to the Sulotco processing facility in the Bolokan valley. At the processing facility, cherries are soaked for 24 hours and less dense and damaged coffee (floaters) are removed. Then the remaining cherries are moved to raised beds and dried to 11 percent moisture over a period of at least 2 weeks. The dried cherries are stored until it is time to mill and export the coffee, which is also done at the same processing facility and includes hand-sorting as the final step.\" - Royal Coffee",
            "Some of the more adventurous producers in Indonesia have begun releasing more and more coffees with non-traditional processing methods. It can be a bit confusing for folks who are long time fans of wet-hulled Indonesian coffee, but we're all about trying new things here at TCC. Especially when they turn out to be so delicious! This coffee has the usual hallmarks of natural processed coffee": " silky body, twisty complexity and very fruit forward flavors. What is a bit unusual about it is that it's got a surprisingly clean finish! As far as flavor goes, we noted guava, pineapple, blackberry and a touch of cocoa. The cup also has a pleasant winey tang to it, though not as tannic as a typical Kenyan coffee. Definitely a must try for fans of natural processed coffee!"

We find a full medium roast brings out the best all the blendcomponentshave to offer as well as resulting in a nice big, velvety crema.
